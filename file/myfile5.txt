Provably good mesh generation.
M. Bern,
D. Eppstein, and 

J. Gilbert.
31st IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci.,
St. Louis, Missouri, 1990, pp. 231–241.
J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 48: 384–409, 1994 (special issue for 31st FOCS).

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

				Reviewed by Frederic Matheus

				Numerical computations regarding the discretization of Dirichlet problems in polygonal domains need to generate triangulations with right or acute angles. The author considers here a recent work of Bern, Mitchell and Ruppert which uses circle packings to generate such meshes and speed up a key step of their method in which circles are packed into a non-simply connected polygonal region to connect its boundary components. 

In the work of Bern et al., this step was computed in $O(n\log\sp {2}n)$ time. The new method presented here leads to an overall speedup of a logarithmic factor, which makes the whole algorithm work in total time $O(n\log n)$. 

This method for connecting the boundary components of a polygon relies on a combination of several known techniques such as: Voronoi diagrams, minimum spanning trees, intersection graphs, neighborhood system algorithms of Eppstein, Miller and Teng, and dynamic tree techniques of Sleator and Tarjan.

				Geometric lower bounds for parametric matroid optimization
				David Eppstein
				Discrete & Computational Geometry 20:463–476, 1998
				Mathematical Reviews 99h:90082, 1999
				Reviewed by Jesús A. De Loera

				The author deduces some results on matroid optimization by using geometric techniques. For example, the following lower bounds are proved, using their relation to polygon arrangements and lower envelopes of line segments: (1) There can be $\Omega (nr\sp {1/3})$ different minimum weight bases in a matroid with $n$ elements, rank $r$ and element weights linearly varying with time. (2) There can be $\Omega (m \alpha(n))$ different minimum spanning trees in a graph with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, and edge weights linearly varying with time, where $\alpha(n)$ denotes the inverse Ackermann function. 

Recently, T. K. Dey [Discrete Comput. Geom. 19 (1998), no. 3, Special Issue, 373--382; MR 98k:52018] obtained an $O(nr\sp {1/3})$ upper bound on the number of base changes in a parametric matroid optimization problem, that matches the lower bound presented in this article.

Average case analysis of dynamic geometric optimization.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 93-18, ICS, UCI, 1993.

5th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Arlington, 1994, pp. 77–86.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 6: 45–68, 1996.

The Tech. Report used the more informative title
"Updating widths and maximum spanning trees using the rotating caliper graph",
which I also used for the journal submission,
but the referees made me change it back.
Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the rotating caliper
graph of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.

Partial cubes and media theory

Algorithms for media.

Int.
Conf. Ordinal and Symbolic Data Analysis, Irvine, 2003.
Discrete Applied Mathematics 156 (8): 1308–1320, 2008.

Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
medium, a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

12th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, New York, 2004.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 3383, 2004, pp. 173–183.

We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
partial cubes:
one based on
finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.

Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this

Cubic partial cubes from simplicial arrangements.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/0510263.
Electronic
J. Combinatorics 13(1) #R79, 2006.

We show how to construct a cubic partial cube from any simplicial
arrangement of lines or pseudolines in the projective plane. As a
consequence, we find nine new infinite families of cubic partial cubes
as well as many sporadic examples.

Upright-quad drawing of st-planar learning spaces.

J. Graph Algorithms and Applications 12 (1): 51–72, 2008 (special
issue for GD'06).

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

Happy endings for flip graphs.
D. Eppstein.

23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.
J. Computational Geometry 1 (1): 3–28, 2010.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

Manhattan orbifolds.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.MG/0612109.
Topology and

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

arXiv:0704.2919.
38th Meeting of the European Mathematical Psychology Group, Luxembourg, 2007.

We describe tests for whether the union-closure of a set family is
well-graded, and algorithms for finding a minimal well-graded
union-closed superfamily of a given set family.

Recognizing partial cubes in quadratic time.

San Francisco, 2008, pp. 1258–1266.
J. Graph
    Algorithms and Applications 15 (2): 269–293, 2011.

We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a hypercube, in time
O(n2), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from "algorithms for media".

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including "Algorithms for Media", "Algorithms for Drawing Media", "Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces", and
"The Lattice Dimension of a Graph".

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper Algorithms for Drawing Media. Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the

spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel

				Reviewed by Fabrizio Luccio

				Based on the fundamental sparsification technique devised by Eppstein, Galil, Italiano and Nissenzweig for the design of dynamic graph algorithms, this paper shows how a planar graph can be efficiently processed under the insertions and deletions of edges that preserve planarity. Although the definition of planarity crucially relies on the concept of plane embedding, the present technique is applied independently of the embedding, which may be altered by the graph changes.

The major results are a fully dynamic planarity test working in $O(n^{1/2})$ amortized time per update or query, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and various efficient dynamic algorithms to maintain connected components, minimum spanning forests, and 2-edge-connected components, all valid for planar graphs. As an overall comment, this is a significant and useful addition to the algorithmic theory of planar graphs.

A Fractal Beta-Skeleton with High Dilation
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
A Fractal Beta-Skeleton with High Dilation


A beta-skeleton is a graph formed from a set of points
by connecting two points x,y by an edge as long as there is no third
point z forming a very large angle xzy (that is, an angle greater than a
certain function depending inversely on the parameter beta).
For large values of beta (beta>1) you get a planar graph,
but as beta goes to zero the graph you get tends to have more and more
edges until eventually you reach the complete graph.


One of the original applications for these graphs is in "empirical networks".
Suppose you discover the ruins of several ancient Mayan cities in the
central American jungle.  Which pairs of cities should you expect to be connected by roads?  The exact answer depends on the details of history,
but you can make a guess based on the facts that people will tend to travel between every pair of cities, and don't tend to go too far out of their way.
So if the shortest route from city x to city y passes near some other city
z, people will likely stop there, but otherwise they are likely to go directly
from x to y.  In other words, we can model the likely set of roads by
something like a beta-skeleton.  Obviously this idea would be useful
in designing new networks as well as in predicting the patterns of old ones.


So how good a road network do you get if you use the beta-skeleton?






Not very good at all!


The fractal curve depicted above defines sets of points
for which the beta-skeleton is just the curve itself.
In other words, the road network consists of a single
road with cities strung out along it, much like Highway 99
in central California.  But unlike Highway 99, the road is not very straight.
If there are n cities, the length of the curve
(relative to the distance between its endpoints) is
proportional to a power of n determined by the
curve's fractal dimension.
The figure above works for some particular values of beta,
but by making the fractal flatter we can perform a similar construction
for arbitrarily small beta.

So the dilation of this network,
a factor relating distance in the network and Euclidean distance,
is non-constant.
In terms of the original road network problem, if you use a
beta-skeleton road network, you can be forced to travel many times
further than the true distance "as the crow flies".


[From "Beta-Skeletons Have
Unbounded Dilation".  For other ways of constructing
networks with better dilation, see my survey
"Spanners and Spanning Trees".]

Nearest neighbors

Iterated nearest neighbors and finding minimal polytopes.
D. Eppstein and 
J. Erickson.
Tech. Rep. 92-71, ICS, UCI, 1992.

4th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Austin, 1993, pp. 64–73.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 11: 321–350, 1994.

Showed that for various optimization criteria, the
optimal polygon containing k of n
points must be near one of the points, hence one can transform
time bounds involving several factors of n
to bounds linear in n but polynomial in k.
Used as a subroutine are data structures for finding several
nearest neighbors in rectilinear metric spaces, and
algorithms for finding the
deepest point in an arrangement of cubes or
spheres.

Dynamic Euclidean minimum spanning trees and extrema of binary functions.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-05, ICS, UCI, 1992.
Tech. Rep. 92-88, ICS, UCI, 1992.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 13: 111–122, 1995.

Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
minimum spanning tree can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt n) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

Algorithms for proximity problems in higher dimensions.

M. T. Dickerson and D. Eppstein.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 5: 277–291, 1996.

Combines a method from
"Provably good mesh generation" for
finding sparse high-dimensional Delaunay triangulations,
a method of Dickerson, Drysdale, and Sack
["Simple
algorithms for enumerating interpoint distances", IJCGA 1992]
for using Delaunay
triangulations to search for nearest neighbors,
and a method of Frederickson for speeding up tree-based searches.
The results are fast algorithms for several proximity problems
such as finding the k nearest neighbors to each point
in a given point set.

A parallelization of the quadtree constructions in
"Provably good mesh generation",
in an integer model of computation, based on a technique of
sorting the input points using values formed by shuffling the binary
representations of the coordinates.
A side-effect is an efficient construction for the "fair split tree"
hierarchical clustering method used by Callahan and Kosaraju for various
nearest neighbor problems.

Disc. Comp. Geom. 17: 263–282, 1997.

Paterson and Yao presented a paper at ICALP showing among other things
that any connected nearest neighbor forest
with diameter D has O(D9) vertices.
This paper is the journal version; my contribution consists
of improving that bound to O(D5), which is tight.

A deterministic linear time algorithm for geometric separators
and its applications.
D. Eppstein, 

G.L. Miller, and 

S.-H. Teng.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 99–108.
Fundamenta Informaticae 22: 309–330, 1995
(special issue on computational geometry).

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Computing the discrepancy.

D. P. Dobkin and D. Eppstein.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 47–52.

Measures how well a sample of points from a set works as a discrete
approximation to the continuous measure of shapes in the set,
using algorithms based on Overmars and van Leeuwen's dynamic convex hull
data structure.
Some versions of the problem also involve subroutines
for finding the deepest point in an arrangement of quadrants or orthants.

This paper was merged with results of Mitchell to form the journal version,
"Computing the discrepancy with applications

Approximating center points with iterated Radon points.

K. Clarkson, D. Eppstein, 
G.L. Miller,
C. Sturtivant, and 
S.-H. Teng.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98.
Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 6 (3): 357–377, 1996.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

Multivariate regression depth.

16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 28 (1): 1–17, 2002.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from

We compute the regression depth of a k-flat

the best known algorithms for computing the depth of a point or of a

J. Amer. Stat. Assoc. 99 (468): 976–979, 2004.

Discusses a paper by Mizera and Müller on depth-based methods
for simultaneously fitting both a center and a radius to a set of
sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model
of a higher dimensional hyperbolic
space.  Reformulates their method in
combinatorial terms more
likely to be familiar to computational geometers, and discusses
the algorithmic implications of their work.

				If a parametric optimization problem and a desired optimal solution are given, the parameter values that lead to the given problem and the solution are to be sought. This is an "inverse parametric optimization" problem. This paper describes algorithms for solving such problems for minimum spanning trees, shortest paths and some other subgraph problems and discusses applications in multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board game programming.

Tetrahedra Classified by Bad Angles
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Tetrahedra Classified by Bad Angles


Simplices are the higher dimensional generalizations of triangles and
tetrahedra.  We are interested in measuring the suitability of a given
simplex for use in an unstructured finite element mesh.


Each k-dimensional face
in a d-simplex (e.g. vertex or edge in a tetrahedron)
defines an angle, and 
all angles that involve the entire simplex are so defined. 
To measure an angle, we place
a small sphere around the k-face and determine
what fraction of the sphere lies interior to the simplex.
The sphere is (d-k-1)-dimensional and lies in a 
(d-k)-dimensional subspace perpendicular to the
k-face; its center is
the projection of the face onto the subspace. 
If k = d - 2, we call the angle a dihedral angle
and we can write its measure in degrees in the usual way.
If k = 0, the angle is called a solid angle.


We can now define a family of problems:  for each k, we can
demand either no small angles, that is, all angles must be bounded
away from zero, or no large angles---all angles must
be bounded away from flat (half the sphere).
This family forms two sequences of difficulty.
No small angle at a 0-face (no small solid
angle) implies no small angle at a 1-face, which
implies no small angle at a 2-face, and so forth up to
no small angle at a (d-2)-face. 
No-large-angle problems reverse the order:
no large dihedral implies no large angle at a (d-3)-face,
which implies no large angle at a (d-4)-face, and so forth down
to no large solid angle.
There are two bridges between the sequences.
No small solid angle implies no large dihedral, and hence
good angles of all types.
In the opposite direction,
a large solid angle implies a small dihedral, and hence
bad angles of all types.


A (j,k)-bad-angle simplex,
0 j,k d-1,
allows small angles at faces of dimension up to j-1
and large angles at faces of dimension down to k.
The case j = 0 allows no small angles, and hence no
bad angles at all, so k is irrelevant.
On the other extreme, k = 0 allows a large solid angle and
renders j irrelevant.
Except for these extreme cases all other combinations
of j and k are possible, so there are
2 + (d - 1)2
different types of simplices.




The figure above illustrates this classification
for the case d = 3.
The ideal "round" tetrahedra have neither small nor large angles.
A "needle" allows small solid angles, but not small or large dihedrals.
A "wedge" allows small but not large dihedrals.
A "spindle" allows large but not small dihedrals, and
small but not large solid angles.
A "sliver" allows large and small dihedrals, and small but not large
solid angles.
And a "cap" allows bad angles of all types including large solid angles.

Straight skeletons

Raising roofs, crashing cycles, and playing pool: applications of
a data structure for finding pairwise interactions.
D. Eppstein and 
J. Erickson.

14th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Minneapolis, 1998, pp. 58–67.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 22 (4): 569–592, 1999 (special issue for SCG 1998).

We use my dynamic closest pair data structure
from "Dynamic Euclidean minimum
spanning trees" to detect collisions among a collection of moving
objects in sublinear time per collision.  As one application, we can
construct the straight skeleton of Aichholzer et al (and the mitered
offset curves from which it is defined) in subquadratic time.

Motorcycle graphs: canonical quad mesh partitioning.

E. Kim,
and R. Tamstorf.
Proc. 6th Symp. Geometry Processing, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2008.
Computer Graphics Forum 27 (5): 1477–1486, 2008.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in straight skeleton construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

Straight skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra.

arXiv:0805.0022.
Proc. 16th European Symp. Algorithms, Karlsruhe, Germany,
2008.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5193, 2008, pp. 148–160.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Closest Pair Methods
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Closest Pair Data Structures:
Methods

We have designed, analyzed, and implemented several different closest
pair data structures.  See the papers
or source code for more detail.
We analyze the times in terms of two parameters:
n, the number of objects in the set, and
Q, the time per operation to perform insertions,
deletions, and nearest neighbor queries in a dynamic set of objects.
Our implementations use trivial nearest neighbor searching
(just examine the distances to each objects), for which Q=O(n).

Previously known were:

Brute force. This simply maintains a list of objects,
and finds closest pairs by examining all pairs of objects.
Insertions and deletions are easy, and space is linear, but queries take
time O(nQ) each.

Neighbor heuristic. We store the nearest neighbor to each object.
Each insertion takes linear time, but deletions require recomputing neighbors
for any object having the deleted object as its neighbor, and may take
as much as O(nQ) time.
Space is linear.  In many applications,
deleted objects are unlikely to have high degree, and the empirically
observed time per operation is linear or close to linear.

Priority queue (not implemented).
We store a priority queue data structure (such as a binary heap)
containing all the entries in the distance matrix.
Space is quadratic, but worst case time per update is
O(n log n).


New closest pair data structures:

Quadtree.  We group the entries of the adjacency matrix
into 2x2 squares, compute the maximum in each square, interpret these
maxima as the distances for a smaller set of n/2 objects,
and continue recursively.  Space is quadratic, but the worst-case time
per operation is linear (optimal unless one assumes some further knowledge
about the distance function).  This would be the likely method of choice
for relatively few objects with very expensive distance computations.

Conga line. We partition the objects into
O(log n) subsets and maintain a graph in each subset,
such that the closest pair is guaranteed to correspond to an edge in the
graph.  Each insertion creates a new subset for the new object;
each deletion may move an object from each existing subset to a new subset.
In each case, if necessary some pair of subsets is merged
to maintain the desired number of subsets.
Amortized time per insertion is O(Q log n);
amortized time per deletion is O(Q log2 n).
Space is linear.

MultiConga.  This is a simplification of the conga line
data structure in which we allow the number of subsets to grow
arbitrarily, and never merge pairs of subsets.
The time per insertion is O(Q); amortized time per deletion is
O(Q sqrt n). In practice this is faster than conga lines
by a factor of three or more, usually roughly comparible to the neighbor
heuristic, and fast even for problems that cause the neighbor heuristic
to blow up.

FastPair.  We further simplify conga lines by
making separate singleton subsets for the objects moved to new subsets
by a deletion.  This can alternately be viewed as a modification to the
neighbor heuristic, in which the initial construction of all nearest
neighbors is replaced by a conga line computation, and in which each insertion
does not update previously computed neighbors.
Its time both theoretically and in practice is qualitatively similar
to the neighbor heuristic, but it typically runs 30% or so faster.

In honor of artist Mark Lombardi, we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the Lombardi
Spirograph, is available online.

Ramsey theory

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Please refer only to the journal version, and not the earlier technical
report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal
version.

Geometric thickness of complete graphs.

D. Eppstein, and 

D. S. Hirschberg.
6th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing,
Montreal, August 1998.

J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 4 (3): 5–17, 2000
(special issue for GD98).

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

J. Simons.
arXiv:1108.4705.
J. Graph Algorithms and Applications 16 (3): 651–673, 2012. (Special issue for GD 2011.)

This is the journal version of "Hardness
of approximate compaction for nonplanar orthogonal graph drawings". 
It has stronger inapproximability bounds, and more variations of the
compaction problem that are hard to approximate. In addition it includes
a retraction of a buggy approximation algorithm from the conference version.

Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 94-11, ICS, UCI, 1994.

Inf. Proc. Lett. 51: 207–211, 1994.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Hardness of approximate compaction for nonplanar orthogonal graph
drawings.
M. J. Bannister and
D. Eppstein.
Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7034, 2012, pp. 367–378.

We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid
drawing of a graph to use the minimum number of rows or minimum area,
no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.
See the journal
version, "Inapproximability of
orthogonal compaction",
for some improvements and corrections.

Dynamic three-dimensional linear programming.

32nd IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci.,
San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1991, pp. 488–494.
ORSA J. Computing 4: 360–368, 1992
(special issue on computational geometry).

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
linear programming
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in "Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

Various authors have looked at a variant of geometric clustering
in which one must select k points that can be connected by a
small
spanning tree.  The problem is NP-complete (for
variable k);
good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques
but the time dependence on n is high.  This paper describes
a faster approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming in

based on that in "Iterated nearest neighbors"
for reducing the dependence

finds the corresponding sequence of minimum spanning tree changes,

Similarly solves the planar geometric version of the problem

Tech. Rep. 92-88, ICS, UCI, 1992.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 13: 111–122, 1995.

Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the
post office problem, and that the
minimum spanning tree can be
maintained in the same time except for an additive O(sqrt n) needed for
solving the corresponding graph problem.
TR 92-88's title was actually "Fully dynamic maintenance of Euclidean
minimum spanning trees and maxima of decomposable functions".
TR 92-05's title left out the part about maxima; that version gave a slower
algorithm superseded by the result in 92-88.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal
subsequences in linear or near-linear time.

Paths and distances in geometric graphs

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation.

Tech. Rep. 96-15, ICS, UCI, 1996.
arXiv:cs.CG/9907031.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 23: 43–52, 2002.

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for empirical
network analysis and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta>0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(nc), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

N. Amenta,

Graphical Models & Image Processing 60/2 (2): 125–135, 1998.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n log n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n log n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2α(n) log2n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
quasiconvex programming, and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

Happy endings for flip graphs.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

Studying (non-planar) road networks through an algorithmic lens.

Proc. 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL Int. Conf. Advances in Geographic
Information Systems (ACM GIS 2008), Article 16 (best paper award).
Invited talk at INFORMS 2009, San Diego.

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many

SIAM J. Computing 39 (8): 3814–3829, 2010.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Optimal embedding into star metrics.

Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada (best
paper award).
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

Near-linear-time deterministic plane Steiner spanners and TSP
approximation for well-spaced point sets.

& Applications 49: 8–16, 2015 (special issue for CCCG 2012).

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 5: 277–291, 1996.

Combines a method from
"Provably good mesh generation" for
finding sparse high-dimensional Delaunay triangulations,
a method of Dickerson, Drysdale, and Sack
["Simple
algorithms for enumerating interpoint distances", IJCGA 1992]
for using Delaunay
triangulations to search for nearest neighbors,
and a method of Frederickson for speeding up tree-based searches.
The results are fast algorithms for several proximity problems
such as finding the k nearest neighbors to each point
in a given point set.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern

9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

A fractal construction shows that, for any beta>0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(nc), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.

to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We use circle-packing methods to generate

polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

Tangent spheres and triangle centers.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.MG/9909152.
Amer. Math. Monthly 108 (1): 63–66, 2001.

Any four mutually tangent spheres
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles; also available are some
Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers.

Multivariate regression depth.

16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 28 (1): 1–17, 2002.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
"Computing the Depth of a Flat".

Topological issues in hexahedral meshing.
D. Eppstein.
Invited talk at
Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science, Stanford, 2001.

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001, pp. 19–29.

We examine flips in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Note that the Meshing Roundtable version was by Bern and Eppstein.

Global optimization of mesh quality.

Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f1+f2)/(f0+f3).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a hyperbolic geometry
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness > 5.048, as well as the first infinite

on the average kissing number of finite

We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays.
M. Bern

arXiv:cs.CG/0212007.

19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs.

15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the hyperbolic or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in straight skeleton construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into

We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three

that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

We study the combinatorial complexity of generalized Voronoi diagrams
that determine the closest two point sites to a query point, where the
distance from the query point to a pair of sites is a combination of the
individual distances to the sites and the distance from one site in the
pair to the other.

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions

minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.
Discrete
Comput. Geom. 52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013).

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs" and "The graphs of
planar soap bubbles".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

The planarity game involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
n7/6, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.
arXiv:1601.06865.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.

arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of

By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable

Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 125–136.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a

changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether

roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together

The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

The minimum expectation selection problem.

2001.
arXiv:cs.DS/0110011.

Random Structures and Algorithms 21: 278–292, 2002.

We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization

the diagram itself has linear complexity.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

Animating a continuous family of two-site distance function

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic

it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L1 plane.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

arXiv:1009.1904.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in
D dimensions, but that the bounded faces of P are at most
d-dimensional, for some d that is much smaller than

bounded faces of all dimensions of P, and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of P.

stylized visualizations of hierarchically subdivided geographic regions.
There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much
of the geographic information from the input we require the output to preserve.

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions
have constant ply (at most a constant number of them overlap any point
of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

				Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems
				David Eppstein
				J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 3(3):1–27, 1999
				Mathematical Reviews 2001b:05154, 2001
				Reviewed by Paul Klingsberg

				The subgraph isomorphism problem is the following. Given a graph $G$ and another graph $H$, one must determine whether $G$ has a subgraph that is isomorphic to $H$. In this fully general form, the problem is NP-complete; but if $H$ is a fixed $l$-vertex graph, as the author points out, this problem can clearly be solved in $O(n\sp l)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. In the current paper, it is assumed that $G$ and $H$ are planar; and in this case the author develops an algorithm that requires only $O(C\sb Hn)$ time (although the constant $C\sb H$ grows exponentially with $l$---necessarily so, if $\rm P\ne NP$). 

The main idea behind the algorithm is that of constructing a cover $\{G\sb i\}$ for a planar graph $G$ and providing a so-called "tree decomposition" for each element $G\sb i$ of the cover. (A tree decomposition of a graph $G$ is a tree $T$ with these properties: (1) each node $N$ of $T$ is provided with a label $L(N)\subseteq V(G)$; (2) for each $v\in V(G)$, the set of tree nodes whose labels contain $v$ forms a contiguous subtree of $T$; and (3) for each edge $\{v,w\}$ of $G$, there is at least one node $N$ of $T$ such that both $v$ and $w$ are in $L(N)$.) Specifically, for an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, the author shows how, for any positive integer $w$, to do the following in $O(w\sp 2n)$ time. He covers $G$ with a collection of subgraphs $\{G\sb i\}$, so that each vertex of $G$ is included in at most $w$ of the $\{G\sb i\}$; he provides for each $G\sb i$ a tree decomposition in which all labels have $\le(3w-2)$ elements; and he partitions $V(G)$ into subsets $\{S\sb i\}$ in such a way that, for any connected $w$-vertex subgraph $H$ of $G$, if $i$ is the smallest value for which $H\cap S\sb i$ is nonempty, then $H$ is a subgraph of $G\sb i$ but is not a subgraph of $G\sb j$ for any $j>i$. The main result, an algorithm for deciding the isomorphism question in linear time, is then based on dynamic programming in the trees associated to the subgraphs $\{G\sb i\}$. 

The author also uses this technique to construct efficient algorithms for a number of other decision and enumeration problems for planar graphs, including connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph isomorphism, and shortest path.

Algorithms for media.

Falmagne.

Int.
Conf. Ordinal and Symbolic Data Analysis, Irvine, 2003.
Discrete Applied Mathematics 156 (8): 1308–1320, 2008.

Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
medium, a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

Area-universal rectangular layouts.

25th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Aarhus, Denmark, 2009, pp. 267–276.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

Merged with
"Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts"
to form the journal version, "Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts".

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
"Computing the Depth of a Flat".

Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar
tight span construction.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1866.
J. Computational Geometry 2 (1): 144–182, 2011.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a Manhattan orbifold and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L1 plane.

Space-efficient straggler identification in round-trip data

Trans. Knowledge and Data Engineering 23 (2): 297–306, 2011.

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

Manhattan orbifolds.

arXiv:math.MG/0612109.
Topology and
its Applications 157 (2): 494–507, 2009.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

Optimal embedding into star metrics.
D. Eppstein and
K. Wortman.
arXiv:0905.0283.
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada (best
paper award).
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts.
D. Eppstein and
E. Mumford.
arXiv:0904.4312.
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 266–277.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Merged with "Area-universal rectangular layouts"
to form the journal version, "Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts".

Computational statistics

Approximating center points with iterated Radon points.

K. Clarkson, D. Eppstein, 
G.L. Miller,
C. Sturtivant, and 
S.-H. Teng.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98.
Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 6 (3): 357–377, 1996.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

Regression depth and center points.

3rd CGC
Worksh. Computational Geometry, Brown Univ., 1998.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model
of a higher dimensional hyperbolic
space.  Reformulates their method in
combinatorial terms more
likely to be familiar to computational geometers, and discusses
the algorithmic implications of their work.

Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.

We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the hyperbolic or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together
some initial set of fragments (e.g. short sequences that match exactly).
The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

Research
I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms, in particular, for multi-core architectures, external memory model, cache-oblivious model, and their parallel extensions, theoretical aspects of GPGPU computing and MapReduce framework. I am also interested in computational geometry and graph algorithms.


 Prospective students: I am looking for bright and self-motivated students to work with on the topics in parallel, sequential, I/O-efficient and cache-oblivious algorithms and data structures with applications to high-performance computing. If you have strong theoretical or programming background and would like to work on algorithms and/or applications for multicores, GPUs and clusters of processors, take a look at my papers and apply to the graduate program at the University of Hawaii (information can be found here).  Once you are admitted, drop me a line to discuss projects which might be of mutual interest.

Algorithms for drawing media.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.DS/0406020.
12th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, New York, 2004.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 3383, 2004, pp. 173–183.

We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
partial cubes:
one based on
finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.

Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book Media Theory, making journal publication moot.

Manhattan orbifolds.

arXiv:math.MG/0612109.
Topology and
its Applications 157 (2): 494–507, 2009.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs.

15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.
ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(2):15, 2009.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

Tree-weighted neighbors and geometric k smallest spanning trees.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-77, ICS, UCI, 1992.
Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 4: 229–238, 1994.

"Finding the k smallest spanning trees"
used higher order Voronoi diagrams to reduce the geometric
k smallest
spanning tree problem to the graph problem.
Here I instead use nearest neighbors for a modified
distance function where the bottleneck shortest path length
is subtracted from the true distance between points.
The result improves the planar time bounds and extends
more easily to higher dimensions.

Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 94-11, ICS, UCI, 1994.

Inf. Proc. Lett. 51: 207–211, 1994.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Finding the k shortest paths.

SIAM J. Computing 28 (2): 652–673, 1998.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph, where k is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.

The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
k shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The
Computer J. 51: 292–302, 2008.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be

general, fewer than five) trees.

Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1870.
21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
nε-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n1 − ε for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3d/3) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

For the journal version, see "Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular

the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of

at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

Densities of minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as

represent learning spaces and perform efficient knowledge assessment of

structure to build learning spaces on a sample of the items of a larger

modify a learning space to more accurately model students.

For every positive integer n, there exists a set of n
points on a parabola, with the property that every n-vertex
planar graph can be drawn without crossings with its vertices at these
points and with its edges drawn as circular arcs.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 340–351.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity.

J. Graph Algorithms &
Applications 18 (2): 211–231, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

The planarity game involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
n7/6, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

Strict confluent drawing.

J. Computation Geometry 7 (1): 22–46, 2016.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines.
D. Eppstein,
M. van Garderen,
B. Speckmann, and

21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing (poster), Bordeaux, France, 2013.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.
arXiv:1601.06865.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

quasiconvex programming, and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

This follows on to our previous paper on
using graph matching to cover a

extending the algorithms to models

split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing.

Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 10 (4): 347–360, 2000.

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The
Computer J. 51: 292–302, 2008.

Algorithmica 32 (1): 87–94, 2002.

We consider several variations of the problem of
coloring the squares of a
quadtree so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

values that lead to the given solution.  We use
low-dimensional linear programming

such problems for
minimum spanning trees,
shortest paths, and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board
game programming.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between n2 and n3
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

Ramified rectilinear polygons: coordinatization by dendrons.
H.-J. Bandelt,
V. Chepoi,
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1005.1721.
Disc. Comp. Geom.
54 (4): 771–797, 2015.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L1 plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

& Applications 49: 8–16, 2015 (special issue for CCCG 2012).

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an

in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient
and m/(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give

are unable to construct these drawings.

Minimum forcing sets for Miura folding patterns.

J. Ginepro, and

arXiv:1410.2231.
26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

Journal of Discrete Algorithms, to appear.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We study the graphs formed by non-crossing circular arcs in the plane,
having a vertex for each arc and an edge for each point where an arc
endpoint touches the interior of another arc.

Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1502.05334.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

Finding all maximal subsequences with hereditary properties.
D. Bokal,
S. Cabello,

Proc. 31st Int. Symp. on Computational Geometry, Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, June 2015.
Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, Dagstuhl Publishing,
Germany, 2015, pp. 240–254.

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal
subsequences in linear or near-linear time.

Rooted cycle bases.

14th Algorithms and Data Structures Symp. (WADS 2015), Victoria, BC.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9214 (2015), pp. 339–350.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

The parametric closure problem.

14th Algorithms and Data Structures Symp. (WADS 2015), Victoria, BC.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9214 (2015), pp. 327–338.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

Metric dimension parameterized by max leaf number.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1506.01749.
J. Graph Algorithms &
Applications 19 (1): 313–323, 2015.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

Folding polyominoes into (poly)cubes.

M. Biro,
E. Demaine,

A. Hesterberg,
I. Kostitsyna, and
C. Schmidt.
27th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, Kingston, Ontario,
Canada, 2015, pp. 101–106.

We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.

Genus, treewidth, and local crossing number.
V. Dujmović,
D. Eppstein, and
D. R. Wood.
arXiv:1506.04380.
23rd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Los Angeles, California, 2015.

We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus
surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the
number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges
embedded on low-genus surfaces.
Track layouts, layered path decompositions, and leveled
planarity.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
V. Dujmović,
D. Eppstein, and
D. R. Wood.
arXiv:1506.09145.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

M. J. Bannister,
D. A. Brown, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1509.00818.
23rd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Los Angeles, California, 2015.

We describe a system for transforming context-free grammars into
human-readable syntax diagrams, including optimizations that change the
structure of the grammar to make it more readable without affecting the
language described by the grammar.

Treetopes and their graphs.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1510.03152.
27th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, Arlington, 2016, to appear.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap

Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.
Discrete
Comput. Geom. 52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013).

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs" and "The graphs of
planar soap bubbles".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

Antimatroids and balanced pairs.

Erratum (with V. Wiechert).

We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial

and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.

Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.
J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity.

J. Graph Algorithms &

The planarity game involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
n7/6, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient
and m/(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of

By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.

Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 125–136.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

We consider a broad class of highest
averages methods for proportional allocation (the problems of
allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.

26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

ERGMs are hard.

arXiv:1412.1787.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

Strict confluent drawing.

J. Computation Geometry 7 (1): 22–46, 2016.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 522–523.
arXiv:1601.06865.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Quasiconvex analysis of backtracking algorithms.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.DS/0304018.
15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 781–790.
ACM Trans. Algorithms 2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and

obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing

This follows on to our previous paper on
using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to

We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed

that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other

discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

Squarepants in a tree: sum of subtree clustering and hyperbolic pants decomposition.

18th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New Orleans, 2007, pp. 29–38.
ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(3): Article 29, 2009.

We find efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for
hierarchically clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing
the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in
the hyperbolic or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster
perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can
also be used to provide a pants decomposition with
approximately minimum total length.

Interconnect criticality driven delay relaxation.
L. Singhal,
E. Bozorgzadeh,
and D. Eppstein.
IEEE Trans. CAD 26 (10): 1803–1817, 2007.

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.

J. Graph Algorithms and Applications 12 (1): 51–72, 2008 (special
issue for GD'06).

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

14th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2006.
Springer, Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci. 4372, 2007, pp. 77–88.

We consider drawings of trees which, if the leaf edges were extended to
infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the
angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

We show how to choose colors for the vertices of a graph drawing in such
a way that all colors are easily distinguishable, but such that adjacent
vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.
J. Computational Geometry 1 (1): 3–28, 2010.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

IEEE

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

    Algorithms and Applications 15 (2): 269–293, 2011.

We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a hypercube, in time
O(n2), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from "algorithms for media".

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

D. Eppstein,

Springer, 2007, ISBN 978-3-540-71696-9.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including "Algorithms for Media", "Algorithms for Drawing Media", "Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces", and
"The Lattice Dimension of a Graph".

By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O(k)
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving m or n
to one involving min(m, k) or min(n, k)
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the k smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order (k+1) Voronoi diagrams.

similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
linear programming
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic

The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar

Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
medium, a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

We describe a data structure consisting of a sequence of compressed
quadtrees for successively sparser samples of an input point set, with
connections between the same squares in successive members of the
sequence.  Using this structure, we can insert or delete points and
answer approximate range queries and approximate nearest neighbor
queries in O(log n) time per operation.

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a hypercube, in time
O(n2), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from "algorithms for media".

in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and

We formalize problems of finding large approximately-matching regions of
two related but not completely isomorphic quadrilateral meshes, show
that these problems are NP-complete, and describe a natural greedy
heuristic that is guaranteed to find good matches when the mismatching
parts of the meshes are small.

Proc. 6th Symp. Geometry Processing, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2008.
Computer Graphics Forum 27 (5): 1477–1486, 2008.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in straight skeleton construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each

We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

Invited talk at INFORMS 2009, San Diego.

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many

SIAM J. Computing 39 (8): 3814–3829, 2010.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes

A fractal construction shows that, for any beta>0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(nc), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.

priority rectangle containing its (source,destination) address pair.
We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,
and find an O(n3/2) time algorithm for testing whether
a rule set contains any ambiguities.

We show that any graph can be
colored in time O(2.415n),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

algorithms for finding a Möbius transformation of a
set of spheres
in a unit ball or on the
surface of a unit sphere that maximizes the minimum size of a
transformed sphere. We can also use similar methods to maximize the
minimum distance among a set of pairs of input points. We apply these
results to vertex separation and symmetry display in spherical
graph drawing, viewpoint selection in
hyperbolic browsing, and element size
control in conformal structured
mesh generation.

Topological issues in hexahedral meshing.
D. Eppstein.
Invited talk at
Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science, Stanford, 2001.

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001, pp. 19–29.
Engineering with Computers 18 (3): 173–187, 2002.

We examine flips in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Note that the Meshing Roundtable version was by Bern and Eppstein.
Erickson was added as a co-author during the revisions for the journal version.

Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra,
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher and others.

The minimum expectation selection problem.

arXiv:cs.DS/0110011.

Random Structures and Algorithms 21: 278–292, 2002.

We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

Global optimization of mesh quality.
D. Eppstein.
Tutorial at
10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001.

Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between n2 and n3
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

SIAM J. Computing 32 (3): 643–653, 2003.

We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization problem
and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine parameter
values that lead to the given solution.  We use
low-dimensional linear programming
and geometric sampling techniques to solve
such problems for
minimum spanning trees,
shortest paths, and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board
game programming.

but which can not be cut along edges and folded flat.

Note variations in different versions: the CCCG one was only Bern,
Demain, Eppstein, and Kuo, and the WCG one had the title "Ununfoldable

"Ununfoldable polyhedra with convex faces" and

We show that any graph can be
colored in time O(2.415n),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,

whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a hyperbolic geometry
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness > 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
sphere packings in R3.
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0212007.

19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

ACM Trans. Algorithms 2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

Merged with
"Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts"

Voronoi diagrams (and a proof of a complexity bound on the number of
non-empty regions).
M. Dickerson
and D. Eppstein.
25th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Aarhus, Denmark, 2009, video and
multimedia track, pp. 92–93.

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

consecutive ones.

The h-index of a graph and its application to dynamic subgraph statistics.

J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 16 (2): 543–567, 2012.

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

On the approximability of geometric and geographic generalization
and the min-max bin covering problem.

arXiv:0904.3756.
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 242–253.

We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.

The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts.
D. Eppstein and
E. Mumford.
arXiv:0904.4312.
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 266–277.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Merged with "Area-universal rectangular layouts"
to form the journal version, "Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts".

Optimal embedding into star metrics.
D. Eppstein and
K. Wortman.
arXiv:0905.0283.
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada (best
paper award).
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

SIAM J. Discrete Math. 24 (4): 1399–1440, 2010.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be
isometrically embedded into Cartesian products of five (but not, in
general, fewer than five) trees.

Graph-theoretic solutions to computational geometry problems.

Invited talk at the 35th International
Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG 2009),
Montpellier, France, 2009.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5911, 2009, pp. 1–16.
arXiv:0908.3916.

We survey problems in computational geometry that may be solved by
constructing an auxiliary graph from the problem and solving a
graph-theoretic problem on the auxiliary graph. The problems considered
include the art gallery problem, partitioning into rectangles, minimum
diameter clustering, bend minimization in cartogram construction, mesh
stripification, optimal angular resolution, and metric embedding.

Optimal angular resolution for face-symmetric drawings.
D. Eppstein and
K. Wortman.
arXiv:0907.5474.
J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 15 (4): 551–564, 2011.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper Algorithms for Drawing Media. Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

Shows both theoretically and experimentally that the number of times a

the square root of the number of road segments.

Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1870.
21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
nε-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n1 − ε for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar
tight span construction.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1866.
J. Computational Geometry 2 (1): 144–182, 2011.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a Manhattan orbifold and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L1 plane.

D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0911.2890.
Game of Life Cellular Automata (Andrew Adamatzky, ed.),
Springer, 2010, pp. 71–98.

We classify semi-totalistic cellular automaton rules according to
whether patterns can escape any finite bounding box and whether patterns
can die out completely, with the aim of finding rules with interesting
behavior similar to Conway's Game of Life. We survey a number of such rules.

Steinitz theorems for orthogonal polyhedra.

26th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Snowbird, Utah, 2010, pp. 429–438.
J. Computational Geometry 5 (1): 179–244, 2014.

We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.

The journal version has the slightly different title "Steinitz theorems
for simple orthogonal polyhedra".

Drawing graphs in the plane with a prescribed outer face and

Proc. 18th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Konstanz, Germany, 2010.

arXiv:1009.0088.
J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 16 (2): 243–259, 2012.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist Mark Lombardi, we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the Lombardi
Spirograph, is available online.

An earlier paper with Spiro at WADS 2009 provided dynamic graph
algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of
subgraph there are in a larger undirected graph, when the subgraphs have
at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.

We show that a partial order has a non-crossing upward planar drawing if
and only if it has order dimension two, and we use the
Dedekind-MacNeille completion to find a drawing with the minimum
possible number of confluent junctions.

Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7034, 2012, pp. 367–378.

We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid
drawing of a graph to use the minimum number of rows or minimum area,
no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.

Planar and poly-arc Lombardi drawings.

arXiv:1109.0345.

We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.

Randomized speedup of the Bellman–Ford algorithm.
M. J. Bannister and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1111.5414.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO12), Kyoto, Japan, 2012, pp. 41–47.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.
Discrete
Comput. Geom. 52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013).

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs" and "The graphs of
planar soap bubbles".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 126–137.

We show that every planar graph of maximum degree three has a planar
Lombardi drawing and that some but not all 4-regular planar graphs have
planar Lombardi drawings.
The proof idea combines circle packings with a form of
Möbius-invariant power diagram for circles, defined
using three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling.

20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 414–425.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

On the density of maximal 1-planar graphs.

20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 327–338.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

Windows into relational events: data structures for contiguous

pp. 856–864.
arXiv:1209.5791.

We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a

The graphs of planar soap bubbles.

arXiv:1207.3761.
Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry, Rio de Janeiro,

We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

Finding the k shortest paths.

35th IEEE Symp. Foundations of Comp. Sci., Santa Fe, 1994, pp. 154–165.
Tech. Rep. 94-26, ICS, UCI, 1994.

SIAM J. Computing 28 (2): 652–673, 1998.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph, where k is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.

The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
k shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

On triangulating three-dimensional polygons.

12th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Philadelphia, 1996, pp. 38–47.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 10: 155–170, 1998.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

The crust and the beta-skeleton: combinatorial curve
reconstruction.
N. Amenta,

Graphical Models & Image Processing 60/2 (2): 125–135, 1998.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the

graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

SIGACT News 18 (3): 38–40, 1987.

A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
alphametic)
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

Space-efficient straggler identification in round-trip data

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a hypercube, in time
O(n2), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from "algorithms for media".

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper Algorithms for Drawing Media. Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a Manhattan orbifold and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L1 plane.

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in
D dimensions, but that the bounded faces of P are at most
d-dimensional, for some d that is much smaller than
D. Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
P is O(nd), independent
of D. We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of P, and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of P.

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid

no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.

We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be

Given a set of points with weights that are not known precisely,
but are known to fall within some range, considers the possible
weighted centroids arising from different choices of weights
in each range.  The combinatorics of this problem are closely

Speeds up 3-coloring by solving a harder problem:
constraint satisfaction in which each variable can take on
one of three values and each constraint forbids a pair of
variable assignments.  The detailed solution involves
several long hairy case analyses.
Similar methods apply also to 3-list-coloring,
3-edge-coloring, and 3-SAT.  The 3-SAT algorithm is fixed-parameter tractible in that it is polynomial time when the number of 3-variable clauses is O(log n).

Faster geometric k-point MST approximation.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 95-13, ICS, UCI, 1995.
Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 8: 231–240, 1997.

Various authors have looked at a variant of geometric clustering
in which one must select k points that can be connected by a
small
spanning tree.  The problem is NP-complete (for
variable k);
good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques
but the time dependence on n is high.  This paper describes
a faster approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming in
quadtrees, and a general technique
based on that in "Iterated nearest neighbors"
for reducing the dependence
on n in any approximation algorithm.

Representing all minimum spanning trees with applications to

Shows how to find for any edge weighted graph G an equivalent
graph EG such that the minimum spanning trees
of G correspond one-for-one with the spanning trees of EG.
The equivalent graph can be
constructed in time O(m+n log n) given a single minimum spanning tree of
G.  As a consequence one can find fast algorithms for counting, listing,
and randomly generating MSTs.
Also discusses similar
equivalent graph constructions for

Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 96-15, ICS, UCI, 1996.
arXiv:cs.CG/9907031.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 23: 43–52, 2002.

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for empirical
network analysis and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta>0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(nc), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

Algorithmica 32 (1): 87–94, 2002.

We consider several variations of the problem of
coloring the squares of a
quadtree so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

Multivariate regression depth.

16th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Hong Kong, 2000, pp. 315–321.
Disc. Comp. Geom. 28 (1): 1–17, 2002.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.
The full version of this paper also includes results from
"Computing the Depth of a Flat".

We examine flips in which a set of mesh cells connected in a

by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically

connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

The minimum expectation selection problem.
D. Eppstein and

10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.
arXiv:cs.DS/0110011.

Random Structures and Algorithms 21: 278–292, 2002.

We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,

whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a hyperbolic geometry
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness > 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
sphere packings in R3.
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0212007.

19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory

But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal

Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern

9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The
Computer J. 51: 292–302, 2008.

We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

Topological issues in hexahedral meshing.

Topology Methods in Computer Science, Stanford, 2001.

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a

meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the
partial cubes.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be

Ramified rectilinear polygons: coordinatization by dendrons.

V. Chepoi,
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1005.1721.
Disc. Comp. Geom.
54 (4): 771–797, 2015.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L1 plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

Densities of minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in
D dimensions, but that the bounded faces of P are at most
d-dimensional, for some d that is much smaller than
D. Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
P is O(nd), independent
of D. We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of P, and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of P.

20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 327–338.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

The graphs of planar soap bubbles.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1207.3761.
Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry, Rio de Janeiro,
2013, pp. 27–36.

We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

For the journal version, see "A
Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar lombardi drawing.".

Superpatterns and universal point sets.

arXiv:1308.0403.
21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Bordeaux, France, 2013.

Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.
J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

Reset sequences for monotonic automata.

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between n2 and n3
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

The min-max bin covering problem is

be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of

states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

ORSA J. Computing 4: 360–368, 1992
(special issue on computational geometry).

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
linear programming
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in "Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

By removing edges not involved in some solution,

we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O(k)
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving m or n
to one involving min(m, k) or min(n, k)
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the k smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using

Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs.

15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.
ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(2):15, 2009.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets

closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between n2 and n3
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

SIAM J. Computing 28 (2): 652–673, 1998.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph, where k is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.

The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
k shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

We show that any graph can be
colored in time O(2.415n),
by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of

states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed
it isometrically into a hypercube, in time
O(n2), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from "algorithms for media".

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are

drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic

and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown

to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a

connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

We study the problem of minimizing transitions in address signals
on a bus.  The UDRC part of the title refers to an algorithm for coding
signals with at most one transition per signal (using an increased number of
wires); we combine this with a scheme for caching previously coded addresses
and use trace data to compare our technique with previous approaches.

Discusses a paper by Mizera and Müller on depth-based methods
for simultaneously fitting both a center and a radius to a set of
sample points, by viewing the points as lying on the boundary of a model

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

Interconnect criticality driven delay relaxation.

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used

into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned

Densities of minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

Planar orientations with low out-degree and compaction of adjacency matrices.

M. Chrobak and D. Eppstein.
Theor. Comp. Sci. 86 (2): 243–266, 1991.

Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 94-11, ICS, UCI, 1994.

Inf. Proc. Lett. 51: 207–211, 1994.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

that depends on the distance of the query point to the nearest region
boundary.

Flat foldings of plane graphs with prescribed angles and edge lengths.

Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 272–283.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1502.05334.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

the expected maximum degree is bounded to within a constant factor
of log n / log log n.

Approximating center points with iterated Radon points.

9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 91–98.
Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 6 (3): 357–377, 1996.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The
Computer J. 51: 292–302, 2008.

We consider several variations of the problem of
coloring the squares of a
quadtree so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the

We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,

two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty

be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

Game of Life Cellular Automata (Andrew Adamatzky, ed.),

We classify semi-totalistic cellular automaton rules according to
whether patterns can escape any finite bounding box and whether patterns
can die out completely, with the aim of finding rules with interesting
behavior similar to Conway's Game of Life. We survey a number of such rules.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

(ISAAC 2010), Jeju, Korea, 2010.
Springer, Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci. 6506, 2010, pp. 403–414.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3d/3) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

For the journal version, see "Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal
time," which combines results from this and a different conference paper.

Privacy-preserving data-oblivious geometric algorithms for

Proc. 18th ACM SIGSPATIAL Int. Conf. Advances in Geographic
Information Systems (ACM GIS 2010), San Jose, California, pp. 13–22.
arXiv:1009.1904.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

We experiment with our degeneracy-based

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions
have constant ply (at most a constant number of them overlap any point
of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

What's the difference? Efficient set reconciliation without prior

Proc. ACM SIGCOMM, Toronto, Canada, 2011.

We determine the symmetric difference
between two similar sets of items, held by different machines on the
internet, using an amount of communication bandwidth that is
proportional only to the difference between the sets and with low
computational overhead. Our solution technique combines the invertible
Bloom filter data structure from our previous
work on streaming straggler detection
with a randomized sampling scheme that allows us to accurately and
efficiently estimate the size of the difference.

Planar and poly-arc Lombardi drawings.

arXiv:1109.0345.

We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.

Randomized speedup of the Bellman–Ford algorithm.
M. J. Bannister and

arXiv:1111.5414.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO12), Kyoto, Japan, 2012, pp. 41–47.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

We find an algorithm for making all possible deductions based on the set
of candidate locations for a single digit in a Sudoku puzzle; the
problem is NP-hard, and our algorithm takes exponential time, but the
mild form of the exponential allows it to be fast for practical problem sizes.

20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 414–425.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

On the density of maximal 1-planar graphs.

J. Reislhuber.
20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 327–338.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

pp. 856–864.
arXiv:1209.5791.

We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a

We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,
vertex cover number, or tree-depth. However, it is NP-complete for
graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Bordeaux, France, 2013.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 340–351.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We study cuckoo hashing data structures in a model of flash memory in

so the goal is to prevent hot spots that change many times.

Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs

22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Würzburg, Germany, 2014.
Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 210–221.

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.

Balanced circle packings for planar graphs.

arXiv:1408.4902.
22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Würzburg, Germany, 2014.
Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 125–136.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Linear-time algorithms for proportional apportionment.
Z. Cheng and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1409.2603.
Proc. 25th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2014),
Jeonju, Korea, 2014, to appear.

We consider a broad class of highest
averages methods for proportional allocation (the problems of
allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.

Minimum forcing sets for Miura folding patterns.

M. Damian,
D. Eppstein,

J. Ginepro, and
T. Hull.
arXiv:1410.2231.
26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

We give the first known near-linear algorithms for constructing
Gomory–Hu trees of bounded-genus graphs, and we shave a log off

ERGMs are hard.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1412.1787.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

Proc. 31st Int. Symp. on Computational Geometry, Eindhoven, the

Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, Dagstuhl Publishing,

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal
subsequences in linear or near-linear time.

Rooted cycle bases.
D. Eppstein,

14th Algorithms and Data Structures Symp. (WADS 2015), Victoria, BC.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9214 (2015), pp. 339–350.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

14th Algorithms and Data Structures Symp. (WADS 2015), Victoria, BC.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9214 (2015), pp. 327–338.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

arXiv:1506.04380.
23rd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Los Angeles, California, 2015.

We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus

number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges
embedded on low-genus surfaces.

M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
V. Dujmović,

D. R. Wood.
arXiv:1506.09145.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

We describe a system for transforming context-free grammars into

27th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, Arlington, 2016, to appear.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Discrete Mathematics 91 (3): 239–248, 1991.

Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,

(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a

algorithm for the deepest flat.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L1 plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in
D dimensions, but that the bounded faces of P are at most
d-dimensional, for some d that is much smaller than
D. Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
P is O(nd), independent

A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap

Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.
Discrete
Comput. Geom. 52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013).

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs" and "The graphs of
planar soap bubbles".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

Provably good mesh generation.

St. Louis, Missouri, 1990, pp. 231–241.
J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 48: 384–409, 1994 (special issue for 31st FOCS).

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

J. Graph Theory

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Please refer only to the journal version, and not the earlier technical
report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal
version.

Happy endings for flip graphs.

23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.
J. Computational Geometry 1 (1): 3–28, 2010.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar

D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1866.
J. Computational Geometry 2 (1): 144–182, 2011.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a Manhattan orbifold and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L1 plane.

We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.

J. Computation Geometry 7 (1): 22–46, 2016.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)

or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes

A fractal construction shows that, for any beta>0,

Omega(nc), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.

O(n 2α(n) log2n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms.
D. Eppstein.

SIGACT News 18 (3): 38–40, 1987.

A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
alphametic)
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

Sequence comparison with mixed convex and concave costs.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. CUCS-382-88, Computer Science Dept., Columbia University, 1988.
J. Algorithms 11 (1): 85–101, 1990.

Gives an algorithm for finding the minimum number of mutations needed
to transform one input string into another, in a general model
in which substrings may be inserted or deleted at a cost depending
nonlinearly on the substring length.  The time bound
depends on the number of times the second derivative of the cost function changes sign.

The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15n/2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex k-gon
is O(n α(n,k)).  The first bound is tight,
but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

Planar orientations with low out-degree and compaction of adjacency matrices.

M. Chrobak and D. Eppstein.
Theor. Comp. Sci. 86 (2): 243–266, 1991.

Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

Discrete Mathematics 91 (3): 239–248, 1991.

Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,
with few pairs of subsets connected by edges.
(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a
factorization does not always exist.

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Please refer only to the journal version, and not the earlier technical
report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal

The space bounds for this can often be reduced 
by maintaining an offline

O(n2) space and O(nd) time
(matching the best known time bounds)
or in linear space at the expense of an additional log in time.

"Finding the k smallest spanning trees"

Here I instead use nearest neighbors for a modified
distance function where the bottleneck shortest path length
is subtracted from the true distance between points.
The result improves the planar time bounds and extends
more easily to higher dimensions.

Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 94-11, ICS, UCI, 1994.

Inf. Proc. Lett. 51: 207–211, 1994.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Faster geometric k-point MST approximation.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 95-13, ICS, UCI, 1995.
Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 8: 231–240, 1997.

Various authors have looked at a variant of geometric clustering
in which one must select k points that can be connected by a
small
spanning tree.  The problem is NP-complete (for
variable k);
good approximations are known based on dynamic programming techniques
but the time dependence on n is high.  This paper describes
a faster approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming in
quadtrees, and a general technique
based on that in "Iterated nearest neighbors"
for reducing the dependence
on n in any approximation algorithm.

Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation.

Tech. Rep. 96-15, ICS, UCI, 1996.

Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 23: 43–52, 2002.

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for empirical
network analysis and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta>0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(nc), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.

The crust and the beta-skeleton: combinatorial curve
reconstruction.
N. Amenta,
M. Bern,
and D. Eppstein.
Graphical Models & Image Processing 60/2 (2): 125–135, 1998.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

Electronic
J. Combinatorics 13(1) #R79, 2006.

We show how to construct a cubic partial cube from any simplicial
arrangement of lines or pseudolines in the projective plane. As a
consequence, we find nine new infinite families of cubic partial cubes
as well as many sporadic examples.

Interconnect criticality driven delay relaxation.
L. Singhal,
E. Bozorgzadeh,
and D. Eppstein.
IEEE Trans. CAD 26 (10): 1803–1817, 2007.

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so
that each component is part of a critical path, but the number of edges
belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.

Manhattan orbifolds.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.MG/0612109.
Topology and
its Applications 157 (2): 494–507, 2009.

We investigate a class of metrics for 2-manifolds in which, except for a
discrete set of singular points, the metric is locally isometric to an
L1 metric, and show that with certain
additional conditions such metrics are injective. We use this
construction to find the tight span of squaregraphs and related graphs,
and we find an injective metric that approximates the distances in the
hyperbolic plane analogously to the way the rectilinear metrics
approximate the Euclidean distance.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be
isometrically embedded into Cartesian products of five (but not, in
general, fewer than five) trees.

Optimal angular resolution for face-symmetric drawings.
D. Eppstein and

J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 15 (4): 551–564, 2011.

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper Algorithms for Drawing Media. Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane embedding and planar
tight span construction.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1866.
J. Computational Geometry 2 (1): 144–182, 2011.

Shows that, when the tight span of a finite metric space is homeomorphic
to a subset of the plane, it has the geometry of
a Manhattan orbifold and can be constructed in
time linear in the size of the input distance matrix. As a consequence,
it can be tested in the same time whether a metric space is isometric to
a subset of the L1 plane.

Growth and decay in life-like cellular automata.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0911.2890.
Game of Life Cellular Automata (Andrew Adamatzky, ed.),
Springer, 2010, pp. 71–98.

We classify semi-totalistic cellular automaton rules according to
whether patterns can escape any finite bounding box and whether patterns
can die out completely, with the aim of finding rules with interesting
behavior similar to Conway's Game of Life. We survey a number of such rules.

Ramified rectilinear polygons: coordinatization by dendrons.

V. Chepoi,
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1005.1721.
Disc. Comp. Geom.
54 (4): 771–797, 2015.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L1 plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

Densities of minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Erratum (with V. Wiechert).

We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial

appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.

In Knowledge Spaces: Applications in Education,
J.-C. Falmagne, D. Albert, C. Doble, D. Eppstein, and X. Hu, eds.
Springer, 2013, pp. 287–304.

We show how to represent a learning space by a small family of learning
sequences, orderings of the items in a learning sequence that are
consistent with their prerequisite relations. This representation allows
for the rapid generation of the family of all consistent knowledge
states and the efficient assessment of the state of knowledge of a human
learner.

In another chapter of the same book we used learning sequences to
represent learning spaces and perform efficient knowledge assessment of
a human learning. In this chapter we show how to use the same data
structure to build learning spaces on a sample of the items of a larger
learning space (an important subroutine in knowledge assessment) and to
modify a learning space to more accurately model students.

ERGMs are hard.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1412.1787.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1502.05334.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

Metric dimension parameterized by max leaf number.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1506.01749.
J. Graph Algorithms &
Applications 19 (1): 313–323, 2015.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

planarity.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and

D. R. Wood.
arXiv:1506.09145.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

(special issue on computational geometry).

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 6 (3): 357–377, 1996.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

Multivariate regression depth.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the

Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays.

19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n log n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n log n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2α(n) log2n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
quasiconvex programming, and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to

We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed

Happy endings for flip graphs.

23rd ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Gyeongju, South Korea, 2007, pp. 92–101.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

Merged with
"Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts"
to form the journal version, "Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts".

Animating a continuous family of two-site distance function
Voronoi diagrams (and a proof of a complexity bound on the number of
non-empty regions).
M. Dickerson
and D. Eppstein.
25th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Aarhus, Denmark, 2009, video and
multimedia track, pp. 92–93.

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

Steinitz theorems for orthogonal polyhedra.

E. Mumford.
arXiv:0912.0537.
26th Eur. Worksh. Comp. Geom., Dortmund, Germany, 2010.
26th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Snowbird, Utah, 2010, pp. 429–438.
J. Computational Geometry 5 (1): 179–244, 2014.

We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.

The journal version has the slightly different title "Steinitz theorems
for simple orthogonal polyhedra".

Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the
bounded faces have small dimension.

M. Löffler.
Proc. 27th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry, Paris, 2011, pp. 361–368.
arXiv:1103.2575.
Discrete Comput. Geom. 50 (1): 1–21, 2013.

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in
D dimensions, but that the bounded faces of P are at most
d-dimensional, for some d that is much smaller than
D. Then in this case we show that the number of vertices of
P is O(nd), independent
of D. We also investigate related bounds on the number of
bounded faces of all dimensions of P, and algorithms for
efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of P.
The graphs of planar soap bubbles.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1207.3761.
Proc. 29th ACM Symp. on Computational Geometry, Rio de Janeiro,
2013, pp. 27–36.

We characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble clusters as
being exactly the bridgeless 3-regular planar graphs.
The proof uses the Möbius invariance of the properties
characterizing these clusters together with our previous circle packing
method for constructing Lombardi drawings of graphs.

For the journal version, see "A
Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap
bubbles and planar lombardi drawing.".

Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, Dagstuhl Publishing,

We study problems in which the input is a sequence of points in the
plane and we wish
to find, for each position in the sequence, the longest contiguous
subsequence that begins at that position and has some geometric
property. For many natural properties we can find all such maximal
subsequences in linear or near-linear time.

The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

Topological issues in hexahedral meshing.
D. Eppstein.
Invited talk at
Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science, Stanford, 2001.

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

Triangles and squares.

Bellaterra, Spain, 2001, p. 114.

Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections
from this puzzle to the combinatorics of 3- and 4-dimensional polyhedra,
using illustrations from the works of M. C. Escher and others.

The minimum expectation selection problem.

10th Int. Conf. Random Structures and Algorithms, Poznan, Poland, August
2001.
arXiv:cs.DS/0110011.

Random Structures and Algorithms 21: 278–292, 2002.

We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

extending the algorithms to models

for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used

into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

Area-universal rectangular layouts.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

Merged with
"Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts"
to form the journal version, "Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts".

(ISAAC 2010), Jeju, Korea, 2010.
Springer, Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci. 6506, 2010, pp. 403–414.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3d/3) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

For the journal version, see "Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal
time," which combines results from this and a different conference paper.

An earlier paper with Spiro at WADS 2009 provided dynamic graph
algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of
subgraph there are in a larger undirected graph, when the subgraphs have
at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.

Privacy-preserving data-oblivious geometric algorithms for
geographic data.

Proc. 18th ACM SIGSPATIAL Int. Conf. Advances in Geographic
Information Systems (ACM GIS 2010), San Jose, California, pp. 13–22.
arXiv:1009.1904.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

We study the combinatorial complexity of generalized Voronoi diagrams

We determine the symmetric difference
between two similar sets of items, held by different machines on the
internet, using an amount of communication bandwidth that is
proportional only to the difference between the sets and with low
computational overhead. Our solution technique combines the invertible
Bloom filter data structure from our previous
work on streaming straggler detection
with a randomized sampling scheme that allows us to accurately and
efficiently estimate the size of the difference.

Category-based routing in social networks: membership dimension and the small-world phenomenon.

Theor. Comput. Sci. 514: 96–104, 2013. (Special issue on Graph
Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

Randomized speedup of the Bellman–Ford algorithm.
M. J. Bannister and

arXiv:1111.5414.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO12), Kyoto, Japan, 2012, pp. 41–47.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

A Möbius-invariant power diagram and its applications to soap

Invited talk at EuroGIGA Midterm
Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, 2012.
Discrete
Comput. Geom. 52 (3): 515–550, 2014 (Special issue for SoCG 2013).

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs" and "The graphs of
planar soap bubbles".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.

D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We consider a broad class of highest

allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a

folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged

Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing.

arXiv:cs.CG/9908016.
Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 10 (4): 347–360, 2000.

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001, pp. 19–29.

We examine flips in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Global optimization of mesh quality.

Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the rotating caliper
graph of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

Quasiconvex analysis of backtracking algorithms.

ACM Trans. Algorithms 2 (4): 492–509 (special issue for SODA 2004), 2006.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs.

arXiv:cs.CG/0307023.
15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New Orleans, 2004, pp. 853–861.
ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(2):15, 2009.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

We show how to test whether a graph is a partial cube, and if so embed

O(n2), improving previous O(nm)-time solutions; here n is the
number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The ideas are to use
bit-parallelism to speed up previous approaches to the embedding step,
and to verify that the resulting embedding is isometric using an
all-pairs shortest path algorithm from "algorithms for media".

SIAM J. Computing 39 (8): 3814–3829, 2010.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities.

21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
nε-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n1 − ε for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

Treetopes and their graphs.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph

Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my

angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

Defines a class of orthogonal graph drawings formed by a point set
in three dimensions for which
axis-parallel line contains zero or two vertices, with edges connecting pairs
of points on each nonempty axis-parallel line. Shows that the existence
of such a drawing can be defined topologically, in terms of certain
two-dimensional surface embeddings of the same graph. Based on this
equivalence, describes algorithms, graph-theoretic properties, and
hardness results for graphs of this type.

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into
the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each
vertex, and show that only logarithmic bits per point are needed.

We describe polynomial time algorithms for determining whether an
undirected graph may be embedded in a distance-preserving way into the
hexagonal tiling of the plane, the diamond structure in three
dimensions, or analogous structures in higher dimensions. The graphs
that may be embedded in this way form an interesting subclass of the

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist Mark Lombardi, we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the Lombardi
Spirograph, is available online.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

The planarity game involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
n7/6, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an

We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient

of planar graphs.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of

By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable

Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 125–136.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

By removing edges not involved in some solution,

we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O(k)
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving m or n
to one involving min(m, k) or min(n, k)
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the k smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between n2 and n3
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the

shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that

and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

Int. Advanced Workshop on Sequences, Positano, Italy, 1988.
Sequences: Combinatorics, Compression, Security, Transmission,
R. M. Capocelli, ed., Springer, 1990, pp. 59–74.

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

Provably good mesh generation.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

(special issue on computational geometry).

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
linear programming
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in "Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

Finding the k shortest paths.

Tech. Rep. 94-26, ICS, UCI, 1994.

SIAM J. Computing 28 (2): 652–673, 1998.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph, where k is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.

The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
k shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

several long hairy case analyses.
Similar methods apply also to 3-list-coloring,

We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization problem
and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine parameter
values that lead to the given solution.  We use
low-dimensional linear programming
and geometric sampling techniques to solve
such problems for
minimum spanning trees,
shortest paths, and
other optimal subgraph problems, and discuss applications in
multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource allocation, and board

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

that is, given a drawing, choosing to draw one edge as upper and one
lower at each crossing in order to improve the drawing's readability.

We consider data structures for handling streams of check-in and
check-out requests, and that must identify the set of check-ins that are
not matched by a corresponding check-out. We show that, if this set has
size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 16 (2): 543–567, 2012.

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 242–253.

We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.

The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts.

arXiv:0904.4312.
Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 266–277.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Merged with "Area-universal rectangular layouts"
to form the journal version, "Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts".

Optimal embedding into star metrics.

Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), Banff, Canada (best

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

We study the recursive partitions of rectangles into sets of rectangles,

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions

minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,
vertex cover number, or tree-depth. However, it is NP-complete for
graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3d/3) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

For the journal version, see "Listing all
maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

the number of bends per edge is a small constant.

Suppose that P is the intersection of n halfspaces in

efficiently listing the vertices and bounded faces of P.

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and

J. Computation Geometry 7 (1): 22–46, 2016.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

Drawings of planar graphs with few slopes and segments.

arXiv:math.CO/0606450.
Comp.
Geom. Theory & Applications 38: 194–212, 2007.

We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and
few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are
obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).

We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus
surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the
number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges
embedded on low-genus surfaces.
Track layouts, layered path decompositions, and leveled

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many
crossings.
D. Eppstein,

D. Strash.
arXiv:0812.0893.
20th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
New York, 2009, pp. 150–159.
SIAM J. Computing 39 (8): 3814–3829, 2010.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3d/3) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

maximal cliques in large sparse real-world graphs in near-optimal

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We examine flips in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

size k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log
n) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur
that do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution
is possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal
space and high probability of answering queries correctly.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in straight skeleton construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the
geometric coordinates of an embedding of the network, but most previous
work in this area has ignored the space complexity of these encoded tables.
We refine a method of R. Kleinberg for embedding arbitrary graphs into

Invited talk at INFORMS 2009, San Diego.

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

Linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.

The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist Mark Lombardi, we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

An earlier paper with Spiro at WADS 2009 provided dynamic graph
algorithms for counting how many copies of each possible type of

at most three vertices. This paper extends the method to directed graphs
and to larger numbers of vertices per subgraph.

arXiv:1009.1904.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

We apply competitive analysis to the problem of deciding online which cell
phone tower to change to when a phone moves out of the coverage region
of the tower it is connected to. We show that, when the coverage regions
have constant ply (at most a constant number of them overlap any point
of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

We determine the symmetric difference
between two similar sets of items, held by different machines on the

proportional only to the difference between the sets and with low
computational overhead. Our solution technique combines the invertible

with a randomized sampling scheme that allows us to accurately and
efficiently estimate the size of the difference.

Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

Balanced circle packings for planar graphs.

Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 125–136.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the

segments.

for using Delaunay
triangulations to search for nearest neighbors,
and a method of Frederickson for speeding up tree-based searches.
The results are fast algorithms for several proximity problems

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

We study the combinatorial complexity of generalized Voronoi diagrams
that determine the closest two point sites to a query point, where the
distance from the query point to a pair of sites is a combination of the
individual distances to the sites and the distance from one site in the
pair to the other.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

We study the graphs formed by non-crossing circular arcs in the plane,
having a vertex for each arc and an edge for each point where an arc
endpoint touches the interior of another arc.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

(based on finding shortest paths in an
associated DAG) for
reducing any such position to the minimum number of pegs.
We then investigate impartial games in which players alternate peg
solitaire moves in an attempt to be the one to move last.

contrast, the similar problems of determining whether there is an
immediately winning move in checkers, or a move that kings a man,
are both solvable in polynomial time.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.

than 77.08 degrees, and another which tiles a slab in space.

There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much

We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the Lombardi
Spirograph, is available online.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

We extend Lombardi drawing (in which each edge is a circular arc and
the edges incident to a vertex must be equally spaced around it) to
drawings in which edges are composed of multiple arcs, and we
investigate the graphs that can be drawn in this more relaxed framework.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

points on a parabola, with the property that every n-vertex
planar graph can be drawn without crossings with its vertices at these
points and with its edges drawn as circular arcs.

We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.

The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.

The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title

to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor

Superpatterns and universal point sets.
M. J. Bannister,

arXiv:1308.0403.
21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Bordeaux, France, 2013.

Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.
J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.

Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

ERGMs are hard.
M. J. Bannister,

arXiv:1412.1787.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in straight skeleton construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

"Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts"

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

Falmagne recently introduced the concept of a
medium, a combinatorial
object encompassing hyperplane arrangements, topological orderings,
acyclic orientations, and many other familiar structures. We find
efficient solutions for several algorithmic problems on media: finding
short reset sequences, shortest paths, testing whether a medium has a
closed orientation, and listing the states of a medium given a black-box
description.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including "Algorithms for Media", "Algorithms for Drawing Media", "Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces", and
"The Lattice Dimension of a Graph".

(special issue on computational geometry).

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

Discrete Geometry: In honor of W. Kuperberg's 60th birthday,

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f1+f2)/(f0+f3).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a hyperbolic geometry
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness > 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
sphere packings in R3.
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

Near-linear-time deterministic plane Steiner spanners and TSP

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient
and m/(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

Graphical Models & Image Processing 60/2 (2): 125–135, 1998.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

Confluent Hasse diagrams.
D. Eppstein and
J. Simons.
Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011.
Springer, Lecture Notes in
Comp. Sci. 7034, 2012, pp. 2–13.
arXiv:1108.5361.
J. Graph
Algorithms and Applications 17 (7): 689–710, 2013.

We show that a partial order has a non-crossing upward planar drawing if
and only if it has order dimension two, and we use the
Dedekind-MacNeille completion to find a drawing with the minimum
possible number of confluent junctions.

Inapproximability of orthogonal compaction.
M. J. Bannister,
D. Eppstein, and
J. Simons.
arXiv:1108.4705.
J. Graph Algorithms and Applications 16 (3): 651–673, 2012. (Special issue for GD 2011.)

This is the journal version of "Hardness
of approximate compaction for nonplanar orthogonal graph drawings". 
It has stronger inapproximability bounds, and more variations of the
compaction problem that are hard to approximate. In addition it includes
a retraction of a buggy approximation algorithm from the conference version.

Set-difference range queries.
D. Eppstein,
M. T. Goodrich, and
J. Simons.
arXiv:1306.3482.
25th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, Waterloo,
Canada, 2013.

We show how to use invertible Bloom filters as part of range searching
data structures that determine the differences between the members of two
sets that lie in a given query range.

Fixed parameter tractability of crossing minimization of almost-trees.

21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Bordeaux, France, 2013.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 340–351.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a
cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate
the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.

Straight skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra.

Proc. 16th European Symp. Algorithms, Karlsruhe, Germany,
2008.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5193, 2008, pp. 148–160.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

Springer, Lecture Notes in

We consider drawings of trees which, if the leaf edges were extended to
infinite rays, would form partitions of the plane into unbounded convex
polygons. For such a drawing the edges may be chosen independently
without any possibility of edge crossing. We show how to choose the
angles of such drawings to optimize the angular resolution of the drawing.

SIAM J. Discrete Math. 24 (4): 1399–1440, 2010.

Characterizes squaregraphs as duals of triangle-free hyperbolic line
arrangements, provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of them,
describes an algorithm for finding minimum subsets of vertices that
generate the whole graph by medians, and shows that they may be
isometrically embedded into Cartesian products of five (but not, in
general, fewer than five) trees.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L1 plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

vertices have especially dissimilar colors, by considering the problem
as one of embedding the graph into a three-dimensional color space.

and use trace data to compare our technique with previous approaches.

Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 272–283.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 414–425.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

We show it is possible to
triangulate three-dimensional space using only
tetrahedra with acute dihedral angles. We present several constructions
to achieve this, including one in which all dihedral angles are less
than 77.08 degrees, and another which tiles a slab in space.

We study cuckoo hashing data structures in a model of flash memory in
which each memory cell has a limited number of times it can be changed,
so the goal is to prevent hot spots that change many times.

This follows on to our previous paper on
using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

& Comp. Geom. 10: 47–65, 1993.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between n2 and n3
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
linear programming
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matoušek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in "Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph, where k is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.

The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
k shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The
Computer J. 51: 292–302, 2008.

by a dynamic programming procedure in which we extend partial colorings
on subsets of the vertices by adding one more color for
a maximal independent set.  The time bound follows from limiting
our attention to maximal independent subsets that are small relative to
the previously colored subset, and from bounding the number of small
maximal independent subsets that can occur in any graph.

Topological issues in hexahedral meshing.
D. Eppstein.
Invited talk at
Conf. Algebraic
Topology Methods in Computer Science, Stanford, 2001.

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections

Global optimization of mesh quality.
D. Eppstein.
Tutorial at
10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001.

Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional

and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
exponential time
backtracking algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds. 

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

15th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,

ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(2):15, 2009.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
nε-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n1 − ε for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs" and "The graphs of
planar soap bubbles".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under Möbius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
n7/6, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

Structures in solution spaces: Three lessons from Jean-Claude.
D. Eppstein.
Invited talk, Conference on Meaningfulness and Learning Spaces:
A Tribute to the Work of Jean-Claude Falmagne
Irvine, California, 2014.

This talk surveys my work on rectangular cartograms, the 1/3-2/3
conjecture for antimatroids, and flip distance for triangulations of
point sets with no empty pentagon, and how this line of research
stemmed from the work of Jean-Claude Falmagne on learning spaces.

Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1502.05334.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9214 (2015), pp. 327–338.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

Metric dimension parameterized by max leaf number.

J. Graph Algorithms &
Applications 19 (1): 313–323, 2015.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

Treetopes and their graphs.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1510.03152.
27th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, Arlington, 2016, to appear.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of
a graph, weak orderings of a set of elements, or chambers of a
hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including "Algorithms for Media", "Algorithms for Drawing Media", "Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces", and
"The Lattice Dimension of a Graph".

Superpatterns and universal point sets.

arXiv:1308.0403.
21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Bordeaux, France, 2013.

Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.
J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Linear-time algorithms for proportional apportionment.

arXiv:1409.2603.

We consider a broad class of highest
averages methods for proportional allocation (the problems of
allocating seats to parties after a parliamentary election, or of
allocating congressmen to states based on total population).
We show that these methods can be simulated by an algorithm whose
running time is proportional only to the number of parties or states,
independent of the number of seats allocated or the number of voters.

J. Computation Geometry 7 (1): 22–46, 2016.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

A straight skeleton is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of
the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether
the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the
polycube or must stay on its surface.

In honor of artist Mark Lombardi, we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of
regular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,
and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally
symmetric case, the Lombardi
Spirograph, is available online.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

"Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts"

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n log n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n log n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n 2α(n) log2n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
quasiconvex programming, and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

Investigates Voronoi diagrams for a "smoothed distance" in which the
distance between two points p and q is inversely weighted by the
perimeter of triangle opq for a fixed point o, its relation to dilation
of star networks centered at o, and its generalization to minimization
diagrams of certain convex functions. When the function to be minimized
is suitably well-behaved, its level sets form pseudocircles, the
bisectors of the minimization diagram form pseudoline arrangements, and
the diagram itself has linear complexity.

Optimal embedding into star metrics.

Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 5664, 2009, pp. 290–301.

We provide an O(n3 log2n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter λ, find the minimum value of λ
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

paper Algorithms for Drawing Media. Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

We propose a random graph model that (empirically) appears to have a
power law degree distribution.  Unlike previous models, our model is
based on a Markov process rather than incremental growth.  We compare
our model with others in its ability to predict web graph clustering
behavior.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

There are several variations of varying difficulty depending on how much

J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 48: 384–409, 1994 (special issue for 31st FOCS).

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

This follows on to our previous paper on
using graph matching to cover a
triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

We consider a problem of assigning delays to components in a circuit so

belonging to critical paths is minimized. We show the problem to be
NP-complete via a reduction from finding independent dominating sets in
bipartite graphs minimizing dominated edges, and give experimental
results on heuristics.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L1 plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

We consider several variations of the problem of

colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

Rule sets for internet routers and firewalls can be represented as sets

We develop efficient data structures for performing these queries,

Discrete Geometry: In honor of W. Kuperberg's 60th birthday,
Pure and Appl. Math. 253, Marcel Dekker, pp. 239–265, 2003.

We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f1+f2)/(f0+f3).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a hyperbolic geometry
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness > 5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
sphere packings in R3.
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

arXiv:1410.2231.
26th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, San Diego, 2015, pp. 136–147.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

Hardness of approximate compaction for nonplanar orthogonal graph
drawings.
M. J. Bannister and
D. Eppstein.
Proc. 19th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 2011.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7034, 2012, pp. 367–378.

We show that, for several variants of the problem of compacting a grid
drawing of a graph to use the minimum number of rows or minimum area,
no good approximation algorithm is possible. We also develop
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms
showing that some of our inapproximability bounds are tight.
See the journal

orthogonal compaction",
for some improvements and corrections.

Randomized speedup of the Bellman–Ford algorithm.
M. J. Bannister and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1111.5414.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO12), Kyoto, Japan, 2012, pp. 41–47.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

Inapproximability of orthogonal compaction.

J. Simons.
arXiv:1108.4705.
J. Graph Algorithms and Applications 16 (3): 651–673, 2012. (Special issue for GD 2011.)

This is the journal version of "Hardness
of approximate compaction for nonplanar orthogonal graph drawings". 
It has stronger inapproximability bounds, and more variations of the
compaction problem that are hard to approximate. In addition it includes
a retraction of a buggy approximation algorithm from the conference version.

Force-directed graph drawing using social gravity and scaling.
M. J. Bannister,
D. Eppstein,
M. T. Goodrich, and
L. Trott.
arXiv:1209.0748.
20th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Redmond, Washington, 2012.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 7704, 2013, pp. 414–425.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this
force helps avoid the tangling that would otherwise result from its use.

Windows into relational events: data structures for contiguous

24th ACM-SIAM

pp. 856–864.
arXiv:1209.5791.

We study relational event data in which a collection of actors in a
social network have a sequence of pairwise interactions. Contiguous
subsequences of these interactions form graphs, and we develop efficient
data structures for querying the parameters of these graphs.

Parameterized complexity of 1-planarity.

arXiv:1304.5591.
13th Int. Symp. Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2013), London, Ontario
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8037, 2013, pp. 97–108.

We show that testing whether a graph is 1-planar (drawable with at most
one crossing per edge) may be performed in polynomial and
fixed-parameter tractable time for graphs of bounded circuit rank,
vertex cover number, or tree-depth. However, it is NP-complete for
graphs of bounded treewidth, pathwidth, or bandwidth.

21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Bordeaux, France, 2013.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8242, 2013, pp. 340–351.

Many real-world graphs are k-almost-trees for small values of k: graphs
in which, in every biconnected component, removing a spanning tree
leaves at most k edges. We use kernelization methods to show that in
such graphs, the 1-page and 2-page crossing numbers can be computed quickly.

Superpatterns and universal point sets.

Bannister's talk on this paper won the GD2013 best presentation award.
J. Graph Algorithms & Applications 18 (2): 177–209, 2014 (special issue for GD'13).

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1310.3770.
Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO14), Portland,
Oregon, 2014, pp. 92–103.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

The Galois complexity of graph drawing: why numerical solutions are
ubiquitous for force-directed, spectral, and circle packing drawings.
M. J. Bannister,

D. Eppstein, and

Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 149–161.
J. Graph Algorithms &
Applications 19 (2): 619–656, 2015.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

Crossing minimization for 1-page and 2-page drawings of graphs
with bounded treewidth.
M. J. Bannister and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1408.6321.
22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Würzburg, Germany, 2014.
Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 210–221.

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of
drawing a graph with a fixed
number of crossings on a one or two page book layout.
By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for these problems, parameterized by treewidth.

ERGMs are hard.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1412.1787.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

Track layouts, layered path decompositions, and leveled
planarity.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
V. Dujmović,
D. Eppstein, and
D. R. Wood.
arXiv:1506.09145.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

Confluent orthogonal drawings of syntax diagrams.
M. J. Bannister,
D. A. Brown, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1509.00818.
23rd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Los Angeles, California, 2015.

We describe a system for transforming context-free grammars into
human-readable syntax diagrams, including optimizations that change the
structure of the grammar to make it more readable without affecting the
language described by the grammar.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented
model. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary
experimental results.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.

In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.

In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of
optimal. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "Mesh generation and optimal triangulation".

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern

9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

but are known to fall within some range, considers the possible
weighted centroids arising from different choices of weights
in each range.  The combinatorics of this problem are closely
connected with those of
zonotopes.

generalized linear programming; we also give
efficient

The crust and the beta-skeleton: combinatorial curve
reconstruction.
N. Amenta,

Graphical Models & Image Processing 60/2 (2): 125–135, 1998.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

Quadrilateral meshing by circle packing.

Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 10 (4): 347–360, 2000.

We use circle-packing methods to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
All elements are kites, or
All angles are at most 120 degrees.

In each case the total number of elements is O(n).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be

regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

Multivariate regression depth.

We generalize regression depth
to k-flats. The k=0 case gives the
classical notion of center points. We prove that
for any set of n points in Rd there always
exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of n. As a
consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation
algorithm for the deepest flat.

We examine flips in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

Möbius-invariant natural neighbor interpolation.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0207081.

14th ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
Baltimore, 2003, pp. 128–129.

Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by Möbius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

Optimized color gamuts for tiled displays.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
arXiv:cs.CG/0212007.

19th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 2003, pp. 274–281.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n3), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
quasiconvex programming algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain

that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation

Given a collection of n sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
linear programming,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both n and d.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

We formalize problems of finding large approximately-matching regions of
two related but not completely isomorphic quadrilateral meshes, show
that these problems are NP-complete, and describe a natural greedy
heuristic that is guaranteed to find good matches when the mismatching
parts of the meshes are small.

We use a construction inspired by the motorcycle graphs previously used
in straight skeleton construction, to partition quadrilateral meshes
into a small number of structured submeshes. Our construction is
canonical in that two copies of the same mesh will always be partitioned
in the same way, and can be used to speed up graph isomorphism
computations for geometric models in feature animation.

We determine the symmetric difference

proportional only to the difference between the sets and with low
computational overhead. Our solution technique combines the invertible
Bloom filter data structure from our previous
work on streaming straggler detection
with a randomized sampling scheme that allows us to accurately and
efficiently estimate the size of the difference.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

arXiv:math.CO/0606450.
Comp.
Geom. Theory & Applications 38: 194–212, 2007.

We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and
few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are
obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).

We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus
surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the
number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges
embedded on low-genus surfaces.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

A deterministic linear time algorithm for geometric separators

9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 99–108.

(special issue on computational geometry).

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

We show that, for any set of n points in d dimensions, there exists a
hyperplane with
regression depth at least ceiling(n/(d+1)). as had
been conjectured by Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any
arrangement of n hyperplanes in d dimensions there exists a point
that cannot escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(n/(d+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our approach to
related questions on the existence of partitions of the data into
subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression depth in
each subset, and to the computational complexity of regression
depth problems.

in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient
and m/(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.

The FOCS and Positano versions of this paper merged my results
on a dynamic program used for RNA secondary structure prediction,
with Raffaele's on sequence comparison.
The Bethesda talk and the TR version both used the longer title
"Speeding up dynamic programming
with application to the computation of RNA structure", and included only
the RNA result, which
used a mild convexity assumption on certain costs
to save two orders of magnitude in total time.
This work incited a boom in computational biology within the theory
community that is still going strong.
But the RNA results were quickly improved by a log factor
[Aggarwal et al. at the same FOCS] and never made it into a journal paper.

The method is to consider a planar point set formed by

and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

All graph algorithm papers

Parallel algorithmic techniques for combinatorial computation.
D. Eppstein and
Z. Galil.
Ann. Rev. Comput. Sci. 3: 233–283, 1988.
Invited talk by Z. Galil,
16th Int. Coll. Automata, Languages and Programming, Stresa, Italy, 1989.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 372, 1989, pp. 304–318.

This survey on parallel algorithms emphasized the use of basic
subroutines such as prefix sums, Euler tours, ear decomposition, and matrix
multiplication for solving more complicated graph problems.

Planar orientations with low out-degree and compaction of adjacency matrices.

M. Chrobak and D. Eppstein.
Theor. Comp. Sci. 86 (2): 243–266, 1991.

Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

Equipartitions of graphs.
D. Eppstein,
J. Feigenbaum, and
C.L. Li.

Discrete Mathematics 91 (3): 239–248, 1991.

Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,
with few pairs of subsets connected by edges.
(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a
factorization does not always exist.

Fast optimal parallel algorithms for maximal matching in sparse graphs.
H. Asuri, M. Dillencourt, D. Eppstein, 

G. Lueker, and M. Molodowitch.
Tech. Rep. 92-01, ICS, UCI, 1992.

We later discovered that the same results were published
in a SPAA paper by Greg Shannon.

Maintenance of a minimum spanning forest in a dynamic plane graph.
D. Eppstein, 
G.F. Italiano, 
R. Tamassia, 
R.E. Tarjan,
J. Westbrook,
and M. Yung.

1st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms,
San Francisco, 1990, pp. 1–11.
J. Algorithms 13 (1): 33–54, 1992
(special issue for 1st Symp. Discrete Algorithms).
Corrigendum, J. Algorithms 15: 173, 1993.

The complement of a
minimum spanning tree is a maximum spanning tree in
the dual graph.  By applying this fact we can use a modified form of
Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to update the MST in
logarithmic time per update.

Parallel recognition of series parallel graphs.
D. Eppstein.
Information & Computation 98: 41–55, 1992.

Characterizes two-terminal series graphs in terms of a
tree-like structure in their ear decompositions.
Uses this characterization to construct
parallel algorithms that recognize these graphs and
construct their series-parallel decompositions.

Finding the k smallest spanning trees.
D. Eppstein.
2nd Scand. Worksh. Algorithm Theory, Bergen, Norway, 1990.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 447, 1990, pp. 38–47.
BIT 32: 237–248, 1992
(special issue for 2nd Scand. Worksh. Algorithm Theory).

By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O(k)
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving m or n
to one involving min(m, k) or min(n, k)
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the k smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order (k+1) Voronoi diagrams.

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Arboricity and bipartite subgraph listing algorithms.

Tech. Rep. 94-11, ICS, UCI, 1994.

Inf. Proc. Lett. 51: 207–211, 1994.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).

Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
formal
concept analysis. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Worst-case bounds for subadditive geometric graphs.
M. Bern
and D. Eppstein.
9th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., San Diego, 1993, pp. 183–188.

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as minimum spanning trees,
matching, and
traveling salesmen,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt n) and the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(log n).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(n).
For traveling salesmen the O(log n) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
dth powers of edge lengths is O(1).

SIAM J. Computing 28 (2): 652–673, 1998.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph, where k is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.

The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
k shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds
on the geometric thickness of complete graphs.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
dynamic graphs (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

Testing bipartiteness of geometric intersection graphs.

ACM Trans. Algorithms 5(2):15, 2009.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean
minimum spanning trees.

split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented

$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these

Many combinatorial structures such as the set of acyclic orientations of

hyperplane arrangement have the structure of a partial cube, a graph in
which vertices may be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that graph
distance equals Hamming distance. This book analyzes these structures
in terms of operations that change one vertex to another
by flipping a single bit of the bitvector labelings. It incorporates
material from several of my papers including "Algorithms for Media", "Algorithms for Drawing Media", "Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces", and
"The Lattice Dimension of a Graph".

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller

rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary

rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a

We consider drawings of planar partial cubes in which all interior faces are
centrally symmetric convex polygons, as in my previous
paper Algorithms for Drawing Media. Among all
drawings of this type, we show how to find the one with optimal angular
resolution. The solution involves a transformation from the problem
into the parametric negative cycle detection problem: given a graph in
which the edge weights are linear functions of a parameter λ,
find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no
negative cycles.

Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities.

pp. 1076–1086.

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
nε-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n1 − ε for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3d/3) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

In honor of artist Mark Lombardi, we
define a Lombardi drawing to be a drawing of a graph in which the edges
are drawn as circular arcs and at each vertex they are equally spaced
around the vertex so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of

and several types of planar graphs. A program for the rotationally

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call Lombardi drawing) then even with a prescribed
child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

Densities of minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Algorithms and Applications: in Honor of Professor Giorgio Ausiello)

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
n7/6, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane
with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with
at most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a
linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.

Small superpatterns for dominance drawing.

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(n3/2), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(n log n), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient
and m/(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,

are unable to construct these drawings.

We show how to express in monadic second-order logic the problems of

By applying Courcelle's theorem, we obtain fixed-parameter tractable

Springer, Lecture

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic

by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1502.05334.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

14th Algorithms and Data Structures Symp. (WADS 2015), Victoria, BC.
Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9214 (2015), pp. 339–350.

We consider the problem of finding a cycle basis for a graph in which
all basis cycles contain a specified edge. We characterize the graphs
having such a basis in terms of their vertex connectivity, we show that
the minimum weight cycle basis with this constraint can be found in
polynomial time and is weakly fundamental, and we show that finding a
fundamental cycle basis with this constraint is NP-hard but
fixed-parameter tractable.

We consider the minimum weight closure problem for a partially ordered
set whose elements have weights that vary linearly as a function of a
parameter. For several important classes of partial orders the number of
changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,
and the sequence of optimal solutions can be found in near-linear time.

by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

23rd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Los Angeles, California, 2015.

We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus
surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the
number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges
embedded on low-genus surfaces.

We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that
the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar
graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of
tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to

the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Graph minors

Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity.
D. Eppstein.
Tech. Rep. 92-06, ICS, UCI, 1992.
J. Graph Th. 17: 409–416, 1993.

It was known that planar graphs have O(n) subgraphs isomorphic
to K3 or K4. That is, K3 and
K4 have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.

More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph Kx,y
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x − 1)-connected graph (namely
Kx − 1,x − 1) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x ≤ 3 or when x = 4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.

that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The

We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets

closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

Densities of minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1009.5633.
Electronic J. Combinatorics 17(1), Paper R136, 2010.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
c(n + o(n); for instance, for
planar graphs, c = 3. We call c the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
ωω, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and 3/2.

Planar graphs

Planar orientations with low out-degree and compaction of adjacency matrices.

M. Chrobak and D. Eppstein.
Theor. Comp. Sci. 86 (2): 243–266, 1991.

Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:math.CO/9907126.
Algorithmica 27: 275–291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).

This paper introduces the diameter-treewidth
property (later known as bounded local treewidth): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an apex graph G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K3,a-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures", J. ACM
48: 1184–1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited", Algorithmica
40: 211–215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of bidimensionality, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications", The
Computer J. 51: 292–302, 2008.

We consider several variations of the problem of
coloring the squares of a
quadtree so that no two adjacent squares are
colored alike.
We give simple linear time algorithms for 3-coloring balanced quadtrees
with edge adjacency, 4-coloring unbalanced quadtrees with edge
adjacency, and 6-coloring balanced or unbalanced quadtrees with corner
adjacency.  The number of colors used by the first two algorithms is
optimal; for the third algorithm, 5 colors may sometimes be
needed.

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional

and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for

separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing

extending the algorithms to models

for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

find the minimum value of λ for which the graph contains no

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one
crossing per edge, and maximal 1-planar if it is 1-planar but adding any
edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on n vertices may have as many as
4n − 8 edges, we show that there exist maximal
1-planar graphs with as few as 45n/17 + O(1) edges.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately n2/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

We investigate the number of vertices that must be deleted from an
arbitrary graph, in the worst case as a function of the number of edges,
in order to planarize the remaining graph.
We show that m/5.22 vertices are sufficient
and m/(6 − o(1)) are necessary, and we also give
bounds for the number of deletions needed to achieve certain subclasses
of planar graphs.

Balanced circle packings for planar graphs.

22nd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Würzburg, Germany, 2014.
Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 125–136.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Springer, Lecture
Notes in Comp. Sci. 8871, 2014, pp. 272–283.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

Simple recognition of Halin graphs and their generalizations.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1502.05334.

We describe and implement a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing
Halin graphs based on two simplifications of triples of degree-three
vertices in such graphs. Removing some auxiliary data from the algorithm
causes it to recognize a broader class of graphs that we call the
D3-reducible graphs. We study the properties of these graphs, showing
that they share many properties with the Halin graphs.

Treetopes and their graphs.

We describe a class of polytopes of varying dimensions, whose
restriction to three dimensions is the class of
roofless polyhedra (Halin graphs). We call these polytopes treetopes. We
show that the four-dimensional treetopes are closely related to
clustered planar graph drawings, and we use this connection to recognize
the graphs of four-dimensional treetopes in polynomial time.

Random graphs and web graph models

Equipartitions of graphs.
D. Eppstein,
J. Feigenbaum, and
C.L. Li.

Discrete Mathematics 91 (3): 239–248, 1991.

Considers partitions of the vertices of a graph into equal subsets,
with few pairs of subsets connected by edges.
(Equivalently we view the graph as a subgraph of a product in which
one factor is sparse.)  A random graph construction shows that such a
factorization does not always exist.

We compute the expected numbers of short cycles of each length in certain
classes of random graphs used for turbocodes, estimate the probability
that there are no such short cycles involving a given vertex, and
experimentally verify our estimates.  The scarcity of short cycles may
help explain the empirically observed accuracy of belief-propagation
based error-correction algorithms.

We propose a random graph model that (empirically) appears to have a

based on a Markov process rather than incremental growth.  We compare
our model with others in its ability to predict web graph clustering
behavior.

Paired approximation problems and incompatible inapproximabilities.
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:0909.1870.
21st ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Austin, Texas, 2010,
pp. 1076–1086.

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+ε)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
nε-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n1 − ε for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

ERGMs are hard.
M. J. Bannister,
W. E. Devanny, and
D. Eppstein.
arXiv:1412.1787.

ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

Metric dimension parameterized by max leaf number.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

				SIAM J. Computing 28(1):341–381, 1999
				Mathematical Reviews 99g:05058, 1999

				A continuation of a series of basic contributions on dynamic graphs, produced by the same authors [see Part I, J. Comput. System Sci. 52 (1996), no. 1, 3--27; MR 97c:05052], this paper deals with the maintenance of a planar graph under insertion and deletion of edges. The main results are low-complexity amortized algorithms to retain information about vertex connectivity. Although the definition of planarity relies on the existence of a plane embedding, the authors devise techniques to keep the graph planar under edge insertion without reference to any embedding (which may in fact change). 

This is another significant contribution to the important field of plane graph algorithms, based on the concept of sparse certificate.
