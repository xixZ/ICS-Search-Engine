     工作機會
    	        
	       
	       貝林資科院的畢業生在就業市場上非常搶手。  電腦相關職缺的需求量本來就高，取得本校學位的學生，又擁有企業亟需的資訊產業本職學能。  能讓雇主馬上有興趣的，通常都是特定學位和相關課程的組合搭配。
	       
	       
	       
	       許多資料來源指出就業市場極為熱絡：
	       
	      
	      根據美國勞工統計局的預估，電腦相關新職缺有將近二百萬個。另外所有工作中成長最快（而且薪水會漲）的前十名職缺中，就有五個屬於資訊科技領域。財經媒體CNBC報導，2010年薪資最高的學士學位前十名中，有三個都和電腦有關。美國資訊科技婦女中心發表一份有趣報告，列出全美各州就業前景與畢業生人數。  請按地圖上的「CA」加州字樣，然後選擇「Download statewide data」，即可看到工程和資訊科學職缺的預測數字比較。

     취업 기회
    	        
	       
	       Bren:ICS 졸업생들은 취업 시장에서 매우 강합니다.  컴퓨터 분야는 수요가 많으며, 본교에서 수여하는 다양한 학위는 학생들로 하여금 자신이 원하는 종류의 컴퓨터 경력을 준비할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.  무엇보다 본교에만 있는 특별한 학위와 그에 따른 일련의 과정에 고용주가 관심을 가질 때가 많습니다.
	       
	       
	       
	       취업 시장에서의 강세는 수많은 자료에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
	       
	      
	      미국 노동통계청은 컴퓨터 분야에서 200만 개의 새로운 일자리 창출을 내다보고 있는데, 모든 가능한 취업 분야에서 가장 빠르게 증가하는 일자리(와 가장 빠르게 상승하는 임금) 10개 중 5개가 IT 분야라고 합니다.CNBC에 따르면, 2010년 가장 높은 임금을 받는 학사 학위 상위 10개 중 3개가 컴퓨터와 관련되어 있다고 합니다.국립 IT 여성 인력 센터는 주(州)별 일자리 전망과 수에 관한 흥미로운 보고서를 준비했습니다.  지도에서 “CA(캘리포니아)”를 클릭한 다음 “주 전역 데이터 다운로드”를 선택하면, 공학 분야의 일자리 전망과 컴퓨터 과학 분야의 일자리 전망을 비교한 보고서를 확인하실 수 있습니다.

     Cơ hội việc làm

Nhu cầu tuyển dụng từ thị trường việc làm rất cao đối với các sinh viên tốt nghiệp đại học Bren:ICS. Nghề nghiệp thuộc lĩnh vực điện toán đang có nhu cầu cao, và hiện có nhiều chương trình cấp bằng đa dạng giúp cho các sinh viên thích ứng với mọi nghề nghiệp thuộc lĩnh vực điện toán mà họ ưa thích. Thông thường, nhà tuyển dụng dành sự chú ý tới văn bằng mang tính độc nhất với hàng loạt khóa học được cung cấp trong chương trình cấp bằng đó. 

Nhiều nguồn giới thiệu đa dạng đều dẫn tới một thị trường việc làm rất được ưa chuộng: 
Cục Thống Kê Lao Động Hoa Kỳ (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) dự tính rằng gần hai triệu việc làm mới thuộc lĩnh vực điện toán, với năm công việc thuộc nhóm công việc có nhu cầu cao nhất (và mức lương ngày càng cao) trong tổng số toàn bộ nghề nghiệp hiện có sẽ thuộc lĩnh vực công nghệ thông tin.Theo kênh truyền hình CNBC, ba trong số những  bằng cử nhân được trả lương cao nhất trong năm 2010 là liên quan đến lĩnh vực điện toán.Trung Tâm vì sự phát triển của Phụ nữ trong ngành Công nghệ Thông tin (National Center for Women in Information Technology) đã biên soạn một báo cáo thú vị về triển vọng việc làm và số lượng sinh viên tốt nghiệp theo từng tiểu bang.

     工作機會
    	        
	       
	       貝林資科院的畢業生在就業市場上非常搶手。  電腦相關職缺的需求量本來就高，取得本校學位的學生，又擁有企業亟需的資訊產業本職學能。  能讓雇主馬上有興趣的，通常都是特定學位和相關課程的組合搭配。
	       
	       
	       
	       許多資料來源指出就業市場極為熱絡：
	       
	      
	      根據美國勞工統計局的預估，電腦相關新職缺有將近二百萬個。另外所有工作中成長最快（而且薪水會漲）的前十名職缺中，就有五個屬於資訊科技領域。財經媒體CNBC報導，2010年薪資最高的學士學位前十名中，有三個都和電腦有關。美國資訊科技婦女中心發表一份有趣報告，列出全美各州就業前景與畢業生人數。  請按地圖上的「CA」加州字樣，然後選擇「Download statewide data」，即可看到工程和資訊科學職缺的預測數字比較。

     취업 기회
    	        
	       
	       Bren:ICS 졸업생들은 취업 시장에서 매우 강합니다.  컴퓨터 분야는 수요가 많으며, 본교에서 수여하는 다양한 학위는 학생들로 하여금 자신이 원하는 종류의 컴퓨터 경력을 준비할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.  무엇보다 본교에만 있는 특별한 학위와 그에 따른 일련의 과정에 고용주가 관심을 가질 때가 많습니다.
	       
	       
	       
	       취업 시장에서의 강세는 수많은 자료에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
	       
	      
	      미국 노동통계청은 컴퓨터 분야에서 200만 개의 새로운 일자리 창출을 내다보고 있는데, 모든 가능한 취업 분야에서 가장 빠르게 증가하는 일자리(와 가장 빠르게 상승하는 임금) 10개 중 5개가 IT 분야라고 합니다.CNBC에 따르면, 2010년 가장 높은 임금을 받는 학사 학위 상위 10개 중 3개가 컴퓨터와 관련되어 있다고 합니다.국립 IT 여성 인력 센터는 주(州)별 일자리 전망과 수에 관한 흥미로운 보고서를 준비했습니다.  지도에서 “CA(캘리포니아)”를 클릭한 다음 “주 전역 데이터 다운로드”를 선택하면, 공학 분야의 일자리 전망과 컴퓨터 과학 분야의 일자리 전망을 비교한 보고서를 확인하실 수 있습니다.

Frequently, it is the unique degree and its associated set of courses that interest an employer in the first place.
           
           
           
           Numerous sources point to a very healthy job market:
           
          
          The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts almost two million new jobs in computing, with five of the top ten fastest growing jobs (and rising salaries) across all possible careers being in information technology.According to CNBC, three of the top ten highest paying bachelor’s degrees in 2010 involve computing.The  National Center for Women in Information Technology has prepared an interesting report on   job outlook and number of graduates by state.  Click “CA” on the map and then choose “Download statewide data” to see a report that compares projected engineering jobs versus projected computer science jobs.

     Cơ hội việc làm

Nhu cầu tuyển dụng từ thị trường việc làm rất cao đối với các sinh viên tốt nghiệp đại học Bren:ICS. Nghề nghiệp thuộc lĩnh vực điện toán đang có nhu cầu cao, và hiện có nhiều chương trình cấp bằng đa dạng giúp cho các sinh viên thích ứng với mọi nghề nghiệp thuộc lĩnh vực điện toán mà họ ưa thích. Thông thường, nhà tuyển dụng dành sự chú ý tới văn bằng mang tính độc nhất với hàng loạt khóa học được cung cấp trong chương trình cấp bằng đó. 

Nhiều nguồn giới thiệu đa dạng đều dẫn tới một thị trường việc làm rất được ưa chuộng: 
Cục Thống Kê Lao Động Hoa Kỳ (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) dự tính rằng gần hai triệu việc làm mới thuộc lĩnh vực điện toán, với năm công việc thuộc nhóm công việc có nhu cầu cao nhất (và mức lương ngày càng cao) trong tổng số toàn bộ nghề nghiệp hiện có sẽ thuộc lĩnh vực công nghệ thông tin.Theo kênh truyền hình CNBC, ba trong số những  bằng cử nhân được trả lương cao nhất trong năm 2010 là liên quan đến lĩnh vực điện toán.Trung Tâm vì sự phát triển của Phụ nữ trong ngành Công nghệ Thông tin (National Center for Women in Information Technology) đã biên soạn một báo cáo thú vị về triển vọng việc làm và số lượng sinh viên tốt nghiệp theo từng tiểu bang. Nhấp chuột vào “CA” trên bản đồ và chọn “Download statewide data” để xem báo cáo với nội dung so sánh những công việc kỹ thuật theo kế hoạch so với những công việc khoa học điện toán theo kế hoạch.

     Trường cao học

Một số sinh viên mong muốn tiếp tục theo học ở bậc học tiếp theo để đạt được bằng cấp cao hơn sau khi hoàn thành chương trình cử nhân. Họ có thể ghi danh vào chương trình Thạc sĩ để theo học các lớp chuyên sâu để dùi mài kỹ lưỡng hơn những kỹ năng ở một số chủ đề cụ thể, hoặc để theo học chương trình Tiến sĩ nhằm hướng tới một công việc trong những tổ chức hàn lâm hay nghiên cứu. Ngoài ra còn có những sinh viên ghi danh theo học ở các trường chuyên môn để có tấm bằng Quản trị kinh doanh (MBA) hay Luật sư. 

Sinh viên Bren:ICS có thành tích xuất sắc về phương diện này, bằng chứng là những cựu sinh viên đạt được thành công ở những tổ chức giáo dục uy tín như Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, và nhiều trường khác. Chương trình danh dự của chúng tôi và nhiều cơ hội nghiên cứu hiện có đã chứng minh sự chuyển tiếp hiệu quả và thành công từ hệ đại học lên hệ cao học của các sinh viên theo học tại trường.

     Trường cao học

Một số sinh viên mong muốn tiếp tục theo học ở bậc học tiếp theo để đạt được bằng cấp cao hơn sau khi hoàn thành chương trình cử nhân. Họ có thể ghi danh vào chương trình Thạc sĩ để theo học các lớp chuyên sâu để dùi mài kỹ lưỡng hơn những kỹ năng ở một số chủ đề cụ thể, hoặc để theo học chương trình Tiến sĩ nhằm hướng tới một công việc trong những tổ chức hàn lâm hay nghiên cứu. Ngoài ra còn có những sinh viên ghi danh theo học ở các trường chuyên môn để có tấm bằng Quản trị kinh doanh (MBA) hay Luật sư. 

Sinh viên Bren:ICS có thành tích xuất sắc về phương diện này, bằng chứng là những cựu sinh viên đạt được thành công ở những tổ chức giáo dục uy tín như Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, và nhiều trường khác. Chương trình danh dự của chúng tôi và nhiều cơ hội nghiên cứu hiện có đã chứng minh sự chuyển tiếp hiệu quả và thành công từ hệ đại học lên hệ cao học của các sinh viên theo học tại trường.

               Some students aspire to attend graduate school to pursue an advanced degree after completion of their B.S. program.  They may wish to enroll in a M.S. program to take more in-depth classes to further hone their skills in certain topics, or enter a Ph.D. program to prepare themselves for a future career in academic or industrial research.  Some students, too, enroll at a professional school to earn a MBA or Law degree. 
               
                
                
                
                Bren School students have an excellent record in this regard, with our alumni succeeding at such prestigious institutions as Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, and others.  Our honors program and the many research opportunities that are available have proven invaluable to successfully transition to graduate school.

	            인턴십은 취업을 준비할 때 꼭 필요한 요소입니다.  인턴십을 통해 학생들은 실제 현장에서 소중한 프로젝트 경험을 쌓고, 앞으로의 진로가 어떨지 미리 맛볼 기회를 가질 수 있으며, 이력서를 채우는 데에도 도움을 받을 수 있습니다.  Bren:ICS 3학년과 4학년 학생들은 대부분 인턴십으로 여름을 보내며, 2학년생과 신입생들도 인턴십을 하는 일이 드물지 않습니다.
	            
	            
	            UC 어바인은 첨단 환경에 둘러싸여 있어서 인턴십 기회가 많은 곳입니다. 하지만, 자신의 관심분야를 추구하기 위해 미국 내 다른 지역으로 가는 학생들도 상당히 많습니다.

     Thực tập

Thực tập là yếu tố then chốt trong quá trình sinh viên chuẩn bị tham gia vào thị trường lao động. Chương trình thực tập cung cấp cho bạn trải nghiệm quý giá về quy trình xây dựng và triển khai dự án trong thế giới thực, tạo cho bạn cơ hội thử nghiệm những thực tiễn của nghề nghiệp tương lai, và giúp bạn có một sơ yếu lý lịch với sức cạnh tranh cao. Phần lớn các sinh viên năm ba và những sinh viên năm cuối của Bren:ICS dành khoảng thời gian nghỉ hè của mình để tham gia chương trình thực tập, và trong số đó có cả những sinh viên năm thứ hai, và thậm chí cả sinh viên năm thứ nhất cũng tham gia chương trình này.


Nhờ có môi trường công nghệ cao xung quanh khuôn viên đại học UC Irvine, nhiều chương trình thực tập địa phương được xây dựng, nhưng cũng có một vài sinh viên di chuyển đến những vùng khác để theo đuổi những chương trình mà họ quan tâm.

	            인턴십은 취업을 준비할 때 꼭 필요한 요소입니다.  인턴십을 통해 학생들은 실제 현장에서 소중한 프로젝트 경험을 쌓고, 앞으로의 진로가 어떨지 미리 맛볼 기회를 가질 수 있으며, 이력서를 채우는 데에도 도움을 받을 수 있습니다.  Bren:ICS 3학년과 4학년 학생들은 대부분 인턴십으로 여름을 보내며, 2학년생과 신입생들도 인턴십을 하는 일이 드물지 않습니다.
	            
	            
	            UC 어바인은 첨단 환경에 둘러싸여 있어서 인턴십 기회가 많은 곳입니다. 하지만, 자신의 관심분야를 추구하기 위해 미국 내 다른 지역으로 가는 학생들도 상당히 많습니다.

     Thực tập

Thực tập là yếu tố then chốt trong quá trình sinh viên chuẩn bị tham gia vào thị trường lao động. Chương trình thực tập cung cấp cho bạn trải nghiệm quý giá về quy trình xây dựng và triển khai dự án trong thế giới thực, tạo cho bạn cơ hội thử nghiệm những thực tiễn của nghề nghiệp tương lai, và giúp bạn có một sơ yếu lý lịch với sức cạnh tranh cao. Phần lớn các sinh viên năm ba và những sinh viên năm cuối của Bren:ICS dành khoảng thời gian nghỉ hè của mình để tham gia chương trình thực tập, và trong số đó có cả những sinh viên năm thứ hai, và thậm chí cả sinh viên năm thứ nhất cũng tham gia chương trình này.


Nhờ có môi trường công nghệ cao xung quanh khuôn viên đại học UC Irvine, nhiều chương trình thực tập địa phương được xây dựng, nhưng cũng có một vài sinh viên di chuyển đến những vùng khác để theo đuổi những chương trình mà họ quan tâm.

     Internships
                
                
                Internships are a key element of your preparation for entering the workforce.  They provide you with valuable project experience in the real world, give you a chance to taste what your future career might be like, and help build your resume.  The majority of Bren School juniors and seniors spend their summer at an internship, and it is not uncommon for our sophomore and even freshmen students to also do so.
                
                
                Given the high-tech environment surrounding UC Irvine, numerous local internships are available, though quite a few of our students venture out to other parts of the country to pursue their interests.

     實習
    	        
	            
	            實習是進入職場的重要準備階段，  除了獲得外界的寶貴專案經驗外，也讓你體會一下將來的工作狀況，同時讓你的履歷更好看。  貝林資科院大部分的三、四年級生都在暑假期間實習，有的大二甚至大一新生也會這麼做。
	            
	            
	            由於加大爾灣分校四周都是高科技公司，因此當地已經有不少實習機會。但為興趣到美國其他地區實習的學生亦不在少數。

     貝林學院
    	        
	           
	           加州大學爾灣分校在2002年成立加大第一個資訊科學院後，就積極投資未來，維持傳統信念，提升卓越的不凡標準。
	           
	           
	           
	           貝林學院在1968年時只是一個科系， 35年後正式升格學院。後來為了紀念捐款人的慷慨捐輸和前瞻願景，在2004年6月更名為Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences。
	           
	           
	           
	           
	           貝林學院是電腦和資訊科學的專門獨立學院，對於資訊技術相關科目有獨到見解，因此能打下厚實基礎。所建立的教育課程和研究方案，皆能探索資訊學科的多種應用，涵蓋電路、系統、軟體工程，以及資訊科技的人文層面。
	           
	           
	           
	           貝林學院把研究工作和多種學科教育內涵冶於一爐，成為跨學科研究的先鋒部隊，足以迎向未來的挑戰。

     Hòa nhập cộng đồng học tập

Lần đầu tiên đặt chân đến khuôn viên trường UCI, bạn sẽ thấy đây là một nơi khá rộng lớn. Hầu hết các sinh viên đang theo học nơi đây sẽ mách cho bạn cách gắn bó và cảm thấy khuôn viên trường nhỏ hơn là hãy tham gia một câu lạc bộ sinh viên. Dành một vài phút duyệt thông tin từ cơ sở dữ liệu của Dean of Student với hơn 300 tổ chức sinh viên đã đăng ký để hình dung được những hình thức tham gia và các hoạt động khiến bạn quan tâm khi học tập tại UCI: http://www.campusorgs.uci.edu/. 

Nhiều cơ hội hiện có để bạn tìm hiểu và thực hành những kỹ năng lãnh đạo, cả trong cộng đồng UCI (ví dụ như Chính phủ Sinh viên, Quản trị Nhà ở) và trong các tổ chức do sinh viên điều hành ở Bren:ICS. 

Bạn toàn quyền quyết định về những hình thức tham gia, nhóm làm việc và về  những trải nghiệm lãnh đạo mà bạn muốn đạt được trong quá trình bạn tìm cho mình một vị trí trong cộng đồng UCI.

     Hòa nhập cộng đồng học tập

Lần đầu tiên đặt chân đến khuôn viên trường UCI, bạn sẽ thấy đây là một nơi khá rộng lớn. Hầu hết các sinh viên đang theo học nơi đây sẽ mách cho bạn cách gắn bó và cảm thấy khuôn viên trường nhỏ hơn là hãy tham gia một câu lạc bộ sinh viên. Dành một vài phút duyệt thông tin từ cơ sở dữ liệu của Dean of Student với hơn 300 tổ chức sinh viên đã đăng ký để hình dung được những hình thức tham gia và các hoạt động khiến bạn quan tâm khi học tập tại UCI: http://www.campusorgs.uci.edu/. 

Nhiều cơ hội hiện có để bạn tìm hiểu và thực hành những kỹ năng lãnh đạo, cả trong cộng đồng UCI (ví dụ như Chính phủ Sinh viên, Quản trị Nhà ở) và trong các tổ chức do sinh viên điều hành ở Bren:ICS. 

Bạn toàn quyền quyết định về những hình thức tham gia, nhóm làm việc và về  những trải nghiệm lãnh đạo mà bạn muốn đạt được trong quá trình bạn tìm cho mình một vị trí trong cộng đồng UCI.

     Campus Involvement
                
                
                When you first visit the UCI campus, you will see that it is a pretty large place. Most students will tell you that a good way to get connected and make the campus feel smaller is to join a student club.  Spend a couple minutes searching the Dean of Student’s database of over 300 registered student organizations to get a sense of the kinds of involvements and activities that might be of interest to you while here at UCI: http://www.campusorgs.uci.edu/.
                
                
                
                Many opportunities exist for learning about and practicing your leadership skills, both in the UCI community (e.g., Student Government, Housing) and Bren School student-run organizations. 
                
                
                
                It will be up to you to decide what types of involvement, teamwork, and leadership experiences you want to acquire as you find your place in the UCI community.

	           2002년 캘리포니아 대학교(UC)에 첫 번째 컴퓨터 과학 대학을 설립함으로써 UC 어바인은 수월성에 대한 기준을 높이겠다는 역사적인 약속을 반영한 미래 투자를 단행했습니다.
	           
	           
	           
	           브렌 스쿨(Bren School)은 1968년 하나의 학과로 출발했습니다. 그로부터 35년 후 대학으로 정식 인정을 받았으며, 2004년 6월에는 Donald Bren의 후한 기부와 선지적 리더십을 인정하여 Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences로 이름이 바뀌었습니다.
	           
	           
	           
	           
	           오로지 컴퓨터와 정보 과학에만 집중하는 독립 대학인 브렌 스쿨은 정보기술(IT) 분야에 대한 고유한 시각을 갖고 있습니다. 그래서 회로와 시스템부터 소프트웨어 공학과 인간 측면의 컴퓨팅에 이르기까지, 컴퓨팅 학문의 많은 응용을 탐구하는 교육 프로그램과 연구 프로젝트를 진행할 수 있는 폭넓은 기반을 제공합니다.
	           
	           
	           
	           브렌 스쿨은 미래 문제를 해결하기 위해 여러 학문에서 연구와 교육을 혼합하면서 학제적 노력을 이끌고 있습니다.

     Đại học Bren

Khi thành lập trường khoa học điện toán đầu tiên trong hệ thống Đại học California vào năm 2002, UC Irvine đã dốc sức đầu tư cho tương lai để thể hiện quyết tâm lịch sử của mình là nâng cao nấc thang ưu việt trong giảng dạy. 

Trường Đại học Bren ban đầu là một khoa được thành lập vào năm 1968. Hơn 35 năm sau, khoa được chính thức công nhận là một trường – và vào tháng Sáu năm 2004, trường được đổi tên thành Trường Đại học Khoa học Thông tin và Điện toán Donald Bren (Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences) để ghi nhận sự đóng góp hào phóng và vai trò lãnh đạo mang tầm chiến lược của Donald Bren. 

Với tư cách là một trường tư chỉ tập trung đào tạo khoa học thông tin và điện toán, trường Đại học Bren có một triển vọng vô song về các ngành công nghệ thông tin, tạo chúng tôi một nền tảng rộng lớn mà từ đó xây dựng nên các chương trình giáo dục và những sáng kiến nghiên cứu mở ra nhiều lĩnh vực ứng dụng của chuyên ngành điện toán; từ các mạch điện và các hệ thống đến kỹ thuật phần mềm và những phương diện nhân sinh của lĩnh vực điện toán. 

Bằng việc kết hợp nghiên cứu với giáo dục trong nhiều ngành học khác nhau, trường Đại học Bren đang dẫn đầu những nỗ lực liên ngành học thuật để đáp ứng những thách thức của tương lai.

     Đại học Bren

Khi thành lập trường khoa học điện toán đầu tiên trong hệ thống Đại học California vào năm 2002, UC Irvine đã dốc sức đầu tư cho tương lai để thể hiện quyết tâm lịch sử của mình là nâng cao nấc thang ưu việt trong giảng dạy. 

Trường Đại học Bren ban đầu là một khoa được thành lập vào năm 1968. Hơn 35 năm sau, khoa được chính thức công nhận là một trường – và vào tháng Sáu năm 2004, trường được đổi tên thành Trường Đại học Khoa học Thông tin và Điện toán Donald Bren (Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences) để ghi nhận sự đóng góp hào phóng và vai trò lãnh đạo mang tầm chiến lược của Donald Bren. 

Với tư cách là một trường tư chỉ tập trung đào tạo khoa học thông tin và điện toán, trường Đại học Bren có một triển vọng vô song về các ngành công nghệ thông tin, tạo chúng tôi một nền tảng rộng lớn mà từ đó xây dựng nên các chương trình giáo dục và những sáng kiến nghiên cứu mở ra nhiều lĩnh vực ứng dụng của chuyên ngành điện toán; từ các mạch điện và các hệ thống đến kỹ thuật phần mềm và những phương diện nhân sinh của lĩnh vực điện toán. 

Bằng việc kết hợp nghiên cứu với giáo dục trong nhiều ngành học khác nhau, trường Đại học Bren đang dẫn đầu những nỗ lực liên ngành học thuật để đáp ứng những thách thức của tương lai.

     Bren School
    	        
	           
	           By establishing the University of California's first computer science school in 2002, UC Irvine made an investment in the future that reflects its historical commitment to raising the bar of excellence.
	           
	           
	           
	           The Bren School began as a department in 1968. More than 35 years later, it was formally recognized as a school – and in June 2004, we were renamed the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences in recognition of our benefactor’s generous contribution and for his visionary leadership.
	           
	           
	           
	           
	           As an independent school focused solely on the computer and information sciences, the Bren School has a unique perspective on the information technology disciplines, allowing us a broad foundation from which to build educational programs and research initiatives that explore the many applications of the computing discipline; from circuits and systems to software engineering and human aspects of computing.
	           
	           
	           
	           By blending research with education in multiple disciplines, the Bren School is leading interdisciplinary efforts in order to meet the challenges of the future.

	           加州大學爾灣分校在2002年成立加大第一個資訊科學院後，就積極投資未來，維持傳統信念，提升卓越的不凡標準。
	           
	           
	           
	           貝林學院在1968年時只是一個科系， 35年後正式升格學院。後來為了紀念捐款人的慷慨捐輸和前瞻願景，在2004年6月更名為Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences。
	           
	           
	           
	           
	           貝林學院是電腦和資訊科學的專門獨立學院，對於資訊技術相關科目有獨到見解，因此能打下厚實基礎。所建立的教育課程和研究方案，皆能探索資訊學科的多種應用，涵蓋電路、系統、軟體工程，以及資訊科技的人文層面。
	           
	           
	           
	           貝林學院把研究工作和多種學科教育內涵冶於一爐，成為跨學科研究的先鋒部隊，足以迎向未來的挑戰。
