Tangencies: Circular Angle Bisectors

Given any two crossing circles A and B (blue), there exist two more circles 
C and D (red) through the two crossing points, that bisect the angles made by A 
and B at those points.  If any two circles E and F (green) are tangent to 
each other, with E and F both tangent to both of A and B, then the 
tangency between E and F lies on one of C or D.  Further, if (say) the 
tangency lies on C, then C is perpendicular to both E and F.



















If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this 
gif.



As usual, this can be proven easily by
inversion: just invert by a 
circle centered on one of the crossing points of A and B, so that A and B 
are transformed to two crossing lines, and C and D are transformed to the 
two angle bisectors of those lines.

Note that the angle bisectors, and their property of containing the 
tangents of pairs of disks tangent to each other and to A and B, continue 
to exist even when A and B do not cross, even though in this case there is 
no longer any angle to bisect.  In this case, the existence of these 
circles is again seen by inversion, to a configuration in which A and B are 
concentric. The existence of these bisectors is especially useful for 
constructing instances of Steiner's porism, 
rings of tangent circles between two circles, since it gives a point on 
each successive tangent circle from the previous one.

If we are given any point x on C (or D), we can construct the tangent 
circles E and F using the four-circle 
property: the four circles A, E, the line L through x and the center 
of C (viewed as an infinite-radius circle), and a circle along the line 
perpendicular to L through the center of A together form a cycle of four 
tangent circles, three tangencies of which are known or easily 
constructed.  The fourth tangency, of A with E, is then the point where 
the circle through these three tangencies crosses A.  Once we have 
similarly constructed the tangency of B with E, we have three points on E 
from which the circle itself is easily found.

Tangent spheres and triangle centers.

arXiv:math.MG/9909152.
Amer. Math. Monthly 108 (1): 63–66, 2001.

Any four mutually tangent spheres
determine three coincident
lines through opposite pairs of tangencies.
As a consequence, we define two new triangle centers.
These centers arose as part of a
compass-and-straightedge
construction of Soddy circles; also available are some
Mathematica calculations
of trilinear coordinates for the new triangle centers.

Tangencies

The following set of nine circles requires five colors, if each pair 
of tangent circles must have distinct colors.  It is an
open 
problem, posed by Ringel, whether five or any finite number of colors 
is always enough for any circle arrangement (having no triple tangencies).



















If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this 
gif.



Ok, I admit it, these pages are merely an excuse for
me to try out Cinderella,
a nice multiplatform Java application by Kortenkamp and Richter-Gebert for 
setting up this sort of animation.  The black spots are anchor points, 
that you can drag around to produce different sets of circles with the 
same tangency pattern.

But anyway, there is some interesting math involved in constructing the 
circles above:


Inversion
Three Tangent Circles
Four Tangent Circles
Circular Angle Bisectors
Steiner's Porism
Apollonian Circles
Many Circles


See also Paul
Kunkel's tangent circles page for even more animated constructions.

Tangencies: Inversion
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Tangencies: Inversion


Inversion is a very useful symmetry operation on circles, generalizing 
mirror reflection through a line.  An inversion is performed with respect 
to a particular center point and choice of scale; then each point in the 
plane is transformed to another point, forming the same angle to the center 
but with distance inversely proportional to its original distance.

The center and scale can be specified as a single circle (shown in red 
in the animation below).
To invert a point outside this circle, such as the blue one in the bottom 
right of the animation, draw a circle (yellow) having as its 
diameter the segment from the given point to the inversion circle's center;
this circle crosses the inversion circle in two points; connect those 
points by a line and also draw the perpendicular line from the given point to the 
inversion center (also yellow).  These two lines cross at the inverse of 
the point.  To invert a point inside the circle, simply reverse these steps.
The animation below depicts several geometric figures 
(blue) and their images (green) under inversion through the red circle. 



















If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this 
gif.



The key properties of inversion are that it transforms circles to 
circles, and preserves the angles of crossings between circles; in 
particular inversion preserves the tangencies of a collection of circles, 
such as the three tangent circles shown 
in the animation.  Note that the blue line through two points is inverted into a circle, 
through the center of the inversion.  When interpreting geometric figures 
using inversion, lines should be viewed as infinite-radius circles that go 
through a special "point at infinity" which is the image under inversion of 
the inversion circle's center.

Many geometric constructions and proofs can be simplified by using 
inversion to transform the figure into a more symmetric situation.

Subject:        A conjecture about 6 points in the Euclidean plane
Date:           14 Jul 1995 17:26:38 -0500
Organization:   Washington University, St. Louis MO

This isn't a homework problem -- it is one from my research.
It may be as easy as a homework given in some class somewhere,
and if so, I'd be delighted to know the answer.  If you know of
a proof, you'll either get a sincere acknowledgement in a resulting
paper, or perhaps even be asked if you want to be a co-author of
the resulting paper.

(Before you get too excited about this possibility, or spend too much
time on this conjecture, my colleagues and I are also trying to find a
proof for a conjecture that would supersede this result, and if we find
it, this proof may never see the pages of a journal.)

Conjecture
----------

You are given 6 arbitrary points in the euclidean plane.

    Technical detail: The conjecture allows more than one of the points
    to be at the same location.  Assume that the points are identified by
    some names other than their coordinates, so that two points that happen
    to be at the same place are still considered different points.

Find a maximum matching for these 6 points,

    Defn: A matching on a set of n points is a set of n/2 pairs of points,
    such that no two pairs contain a common point.  The length of a single
    pair is equal to the Euclidean distance between the points of the pair.
    The length of a matching is the sum of all n/2 pair lengths.  I only
    care about matchings with the maximum length among all possible
    matchings.

Let the matching be {{a_1, b_1}, {a_2, b_2}, {a_3, b_3}}.

Prove that there must exist a point x such that for all i, 1 < i < 3,

dist(a_i, x) + dist(x, b_i) < 2/sqrt(3) * dist(a_i, b_i)

where dist(x, y) is the Euclidean distance between x and y.

Why do I care?
--------------

One interesting consequence is that if such a point exists for any 6 points
in the plane, then it also must exist for _any_ even number points in the
plane.

To see this, note that one way to interpret the statement:

dist(a_i, x) + dist(x, b_i) < 2/sqrt(3) * dist(a_i, b_i)

is to note that the set of all such points x lie inside an ellipse
with foci a_i and b_i.  If we denote this set of points by
ell(a_i, b_i, 2/sqrt(3)), then the conjecture says that the three
ell sets must have a common point.

If this were true, then we could prove the conjecture for any even
number of points by applying Helly's Theorem, described below.

Helly's Theorem
---------------

(Sorry, I don't have a reference, and I don't even know if I spelled
Helly correctly.  I've heard that Helly was Hungarian, and he proved
this theorem while he was jailed during World War II.  If you are
interested in a citation, let me know and I'll ask the person I heard
it from.)

Given any collection of convex sets in R^2, if all sub-collections
of exactly 3 of these sets have a common point, then all n sets have
a common point.

I've also heard that this generalizes if you replace R^2 with R^k, and
3 with (k+1).  Pretty neat, I thought.

Where did 2/sqrt(3) come from?
------------------------------

I know that the conjecture is false if 2/sqrt(3) is replaced with
anything smaller.  To see this, choose the six points such that two
of them are at each of the vertices of an equilateral triangle.  Then
the only point x that satisfies the conjecture is the center of the
triangle.

The conjecture may be false for 2/sqrt(3).  If you know of a
counterexample, please let me know.  In general, I'd like to prove the
conjecture for as small a constant (in place of 2/sqrt(3)) as possible.

Why do I care about proving this?
---------------------------------

The following is just a quick summary.  If you want more details,
just ask and I'll spend more time writing up details.

It relates to an abstract version of a problem in designing communication
networks.  The given points represent nodes that should be connected
by a network.  The length of a maximum matching is a lower bound on
the cost of any feasible network, and the point x is a place where I'd
like to place the center of a "star" network, in which all given points
are connected directly to the star.

If the conjecture is true, I can show that a star network costs at most
2/sqrt(3) times more than an optimal solution.

Have I made any progress myself, before asking the net?
-------------------------------------------------------

Only a little.

Think of the matching of the 6 points as a set of 3 line segments.
Each line segment joins one of the pairs of points.

If every pair of line segments intersects at a single point,
then consider the triangle with these three intersecting points as its
vertices.  For any triangle, there exists a point x in its interior
or its boundary such that each side of the triangle subtends an angle
of at least 120 degrees from x.  If a line segment AB subtends an angle
of at least 120 degrees from x, then

dist(A,x) + dist(x,B) < dist(A,B)

Therefore x satisfies the conjecture.

Someone else working on this conjecture tried breaking it up into cases
based on the number of intersections between the 3 line segments.
The above shows that if there are 3 intersections, the conjecture holds.
The cases for 0, 1, or 2 intersections are still eluding me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Hi --
You sent out this message a couple months ago,
did you get any response?

    You are given 6 arbitrary points in the euclidean plane.
    Find a maximum matching for these 6 points,
    Let the matching be {{a_1, b_1}, {a_2, b_2}, {a_3, b_3}}.
    Prove that there must exist a point x such that for all i, 1 < i < 3,
    dist(a_i, x) + dist(x, b_i) < 2/sqrt(3) * dist(a_i, b_i)

I think I can prove it with a worse constant,
and directly for any number of points (rather than applying Helly).
Also it seems to work for bichromatic point sets as well:

let (a1,b1) be shortest edge in the matching, and let x
be any point on that edge.
Then if d(ai,x)+d(bi,x) > 3 d(ai,bi)
you could replace (a1,b1)&(ai,bi) by (a1,bi)&(ai,b1)
which have total weight (by triangle inequality)
	> 3d(ai,bi)-d(a1,b1) > d(a1,b1)+d(ai,bi).

Therefore your result seems to hold with 3 instead of 2/sqrt 3.  With a
little more care this can be improved (for the monochromatic case only):
if you take x to be the midpoint of (a1,b1), then one of a1,b1 is always
farther from ai or bi than x, so you only need to apply the triangle
inequality on one of the two replacement edges and you get a factor of 2.5.

This is a semi-classical problem.  I think it goes under the name of
Sylvester's theorem.  My favorite proof was discovered by
Noam Elkies, a sometime contributor to this newsgroup, when he was 13.
(I was working at the math program which he was attending; needless to say, we
were astounded.)

The proof is as follows:  This is obviously a question of projective geometry,
so we may dualize (switch lines and points).  So the problem is this:
Given a finite collection of lines in the plane, show that there is an
intersection point at which exactly two meet.  Now remove a line at
infinity which is not in the collection, and return to the affine plane.
Consider the triangle ABC of smallest area bounded by three of these lines.  
If there is a tie, we fix an origin and choose a minimal triangle whose centroid
is as far as possible from that origin.

Since at least 3 lines meet at each point A, B, C, we can find
lines L, M, and N passing through A, B, and C respectively, and not equal
to AB, BC, or CA.  If L and M meet at X, M and N at Y, and N and L at Z,
triangles XBC, AYC, and ABZ have area greater than or equal to that of
ABC.  But it is easy to show that if you divided a triangle XYZ into
4 parts by choosing a point on each side and connecting, the area of the
center triangle is greater than or equal to the largest of the corner triangles,
with equality if and only if all three points are midpoints.
Therefore, XBC, AYC, ABZ, and ABC are all congruent, and one of the three outer
triangles has a midpoint further from the origin than ABC.  The contradiction
proves the theorem.

An even nicer (in my opinion) proof is one I heard from Erdos.  It is
not Erdos' proof, but I forget who he attributed it to.  In fact, Erdos
admitted that he had thought about the problem for a while but failed to
see a solution.

First of all, a technicality: there is an obvious counterexample, namely
of three or more points all in a straight line.  However, if we require
that not all the points of S are in a straight line, then the statement
is true.

Suppose S is finite.  Let L be the set of all lines that contain at
least two points of S.  For any line l and any point p, let d(l,p) be
the distance between l and p.  Let D be the set of all distances d(l,p)
as l ranges over all of L and p ranges over all points in S not on l.
Since not all the points in S are on a line, D is nonempty.  Since S is
finite, D is finite, and thus D has a least element d>0.  Take a line
l_0 in L and a point p_0 in S for which this distance is attained.
Drop a perpendicular from p_0 to l_0, meeting at X.  We have this
picture:

                        p_0 .
                            |
                            | d
     _______________________|_______________________  l_0
                            X

Now, since l_0 contains at least three distinct points of S by
hypothesis, either there are two or more points in S to the left of X
or there are two or more points in S to the right of X.  Suppose
without loss of generality that the former holds, and let p_1 and p_2
be two points in S on l_0, with p_2 closer to X.  Inspection of similar
triangles shows that the distance between p_2 and the line in L
determined by p_0 and p_1 is less than d, contradicting the minimality
of d.

I'm afraid I cannot claim credit to this; the proof is contained in
one of Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" columns in _Scientific American_,
wherein he introduces projective geometry and duality.  I had certainly read
most of these columns in back copies of _Sci. Am._ by the time I was assigned
Sylvester's problem (not properly "Sylvester's Theorem" since Sylvester
didn't prove it), so my solution was at best a subconscious reconstruction
of that proof.

However, I *can* claim credit to an analogous solution to the corresponding
question over the complex numbers, asked by Serre in 1966 (Problem 5359
in Vol.73 (1966) of the _Amer. Math. Monthly_):  Let S be a finite subset
of *complex* projective 3-dimensional space, such that the line through
any two points of S contains at least a third point of S; show that
all the points of S are coplanar.  (We can no longer conclude collinearity
because there are counterexamples in the complex plane, of which the
simplest is the set of nine inflection points of a nondegenerate cubic.)

This was first proved in 1986 by L.M. Kelly ("A resolution of the Sylvester-
Gallai problem of J.-P. Serre", Discrete Comput. Geom. 1 (1986), 101--104),
using an inequality of Hirzebruch on arrangements of lines (or, dually, of
points) in the complex projective plane.  But Hirzebruch's inequality
requires Miyaoka's inequality on the characteristic classes of a complex
projective 2-fold of general type (specifically the surface obtained
by taking the square roots of the linear forms on CP^2 defining the lines
of the arrangement) --- which seems an outrageously sophisticated tool 
to apply to such a problem.

And indeed it turns out that essentially the same idea which gave "my"
proof in P^2(R) also does it in P^3(C): construct the dual configuration,
throw away a generic plane to get a configuration of planes in the affine
plane C^3, and, assuming that these planes are not coincident, consider
those four non-coincident planes forming a "tetrahedron" of minimal "volume"
(the "volume" is defined as the absolute value of the determinant formed
from the coordinates of the four points of triple intersection of the planes).
Again a contradiction is obtained from tetrahedra formed by other planes
which must go through the lines of intersection of those four planes.
To be sure, the proof is not as immediate as in the real case, but it
is entirely elementary.

Note that the generalization to projective space over an arbitrary field K
won't give rise to any new theorems of this kind:  if K is of characteristic 
zero, any finite arrangement of points and lines over K can be embedded
in complex projective space of the same dimension; and if K is of
positive characteristic, it contains a finite field k, and then
the points of projective space of arbitrary dimension over k
give an obvious counterexmaple.

Zonohedra and Zonotopes

A zonohedron is a polyhedron in which every
face is centrally symmetric.
Zonohedra can be defined in various ways, for instance as the Minkowski
sums of line segments.  The combinatorics
of their faces are equivalent to those of line arrangements in the plane.
(See my Mathematica Zonotope
notebook for details of this equivalence as well as more examples of
zonohedra.)

The
equivalence of two face-centered icosahedral tilings with respect to
local derivability, J. Phys. A26 (1993) 1455. J. Roth dissects an
aperiodic three-dimensional tiling involving zonohedra into another
tiling involving tetrahedra and vice versa.

How many intersection points
can you form from an n-line arrangement?
Equivalently, how many opposite pairs of faces can an n-zone
zonohedron have?
It must be a number between n-1 and n(n-1)/2,
but not all of those values are possible.

(They omit the very simple generalization from Euler's

Higher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form
zonotopes) are much harder -- one can find a basis of
short vectors using the well-known LLL algorithm, but this doesn't
necessarily find
the vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according
to Senechal's Quasicrystals and Geometry, although the set
of Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not
known whether this set always contains a basis.)

Building a Better Beam Detector?
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Building a Better Beam Detector?


A beam detector for the unit circle is a set
of points that intercepts all lines crossing that circle.
As we will see, it need not be a connected subset of the plane.
The task is to find the beam detector with minimum one-dimensional measure.
(The detectors we'll discuss are made up of curves and line segments
so this measure is just the total length.)



I first came across this problem in 1986, when Bill Thurston
posted a message about it to sci.math,
and soon exchanged correspondence on the subject with him
and others including Andrew Odlyzko.
Thurston's original message described a beam detector
in the shape of a "bow and arrow": one circumscribes the
circle by a square, extends a quarter-circle by line segments to two opposite square corners (the "bow"), and drops a half-diagonal from the remaining corner to the center of the figure (the "arrow").
This detector is drawn below, and has total length
pi/2 + 2 + sqrt(2), approximately 4.985.





Thurston also included a proof (based on the theory of measures on spaces of lines) that the length of any beam detector must be at least pi.
The point of his message was to ask for better lower bounds.



My response to this message was to modify this bow and arrow,
basing it on a hexagon instead of a square.  It soon became
clear that others had looked at modified bow-and-arrow beam detectors,
including E. Makai, who had published in 1980 a construction with length
4.8189.
He later noted that one of the segments forming an end of the "bow"
can be separated and tilted to form another "arrow", making
a very small further improvement.



Since then, several articles have appeared on the subject of "opaque
forests".  This is apparently the same idea as that of a beam detector,
with three changes.  First, the detector is explicitly required to be a
forest (set of line segments).  Second, the set of lines that must be
detected is that crossing some particular polygon, rather than a circle.
And third, the detector must be contained entirely within that polygon.
This third restriction changes the problem completely;
for the circle, all boundary points would have to be part of such
a forest, and the total length would be 2 pi.
Some early works on this subject assumed that generalizations of the bow-and-arrow idea gave the correct solution, but T. Shermer in 1991 showed
that in some cases one can find a better opaque forest by keeping everything connected (computing a Steiner tree).



My latest (but half-baked) idea for a beam detector combines the
hexagon, bow and arrow, and
Steiner tree.  Start with a hexagon ABCDEF circumscribing the circle.
Connect vertices ABDE with a Steiner tree.
Finally, drop a line segment from the remaining two vertices C and F
to the nearest side of quadrilateral ABDE.
But for the regular hexagon (illustrated below),
this produces a beam detector with total length 2/sqrt 3 + 4,
approximately 5.1547, not bad but worse than the bow and arrow.
(Thanks to John Rickard for the length; I initially miscalculated this value
to be 4.464.) I suspect (but have not calculated) that
non-regular hexagons can be used to improve this value even further,
but maybe that would still not be enough to get a better beam detector.




The latest news in Scientific American
is of a constructor by J. Day with length 4.7998,
but this is not much of an improvement on Makai's bound,
and looks like it may be the same as Makai's old two-arrow improvement.
Is there a better beam detector?

Hi Sa'ndor, 
  
These are beautiful - and phantasy-stirring, especially b1. 
  
I would coin for it the name 
  
 "RHOMBIC TRIACOSIOHEDRON", 
  
since it has 300 congruent (!) rhombic faces (golden ones I suppose). In
addition, it has altogether 600 edges and 280 vertices. 
Thus its Euler characteristic \chi = F - E + V  equals  -20. 
Consequently, its genus g = (1/2)(2-\chi)  equals 11. 
This means that it is topologically equivalent to a doughnut with
altogether 11 holes (or, if you like it more, to a sphere endowed with
11 [torus-like] handlebodies). 
Well, and all this is made of congruent rhombi... (thus it is
monohedral). Nice job! 
  
I am afraid that facing the exercise: "Find a monohedral (!) non-convex
polyhedron with genus 11" 
would be somewhat frustrating experience to quite a number of people
(including geometers). 
  
Congratulations!

Actually the answer of 1/8 doesn't really require uniform distribution,
only a distribution invariant with respect to 180-degree rotation through
the center of the sphere.  The idea is that among the  16 points 
(+/- A, +/- B, +/- C, +/- D), exactly two correspond to "good"
configurations.  This is not hard to see in the probability 1 "generic"
case were A,B,C,D are distinct and no three of them lie on a great circle.
To make this argument completely rigorous one needs only the finite
additivity of the measure, that the non-generic cases have probability 0,
that the set of "good" cases *has* a measure, and that the measure be
invariant with respect to 180 degree rotation in any coordinate.

Subject:        snub cube and dodecahedron (repost?)

hi!

i am making accurate computer models of the Platonic and Archimedean
solids. to the extent possible, i would like to use "nice" constants
in generating them.

the basic metaphor in my approach is to lay out, in the plane, a figure
which when "folded" will yield the desired polyhedron.

describing the polygons and their relationships is straightforward, and
for 16 out of 18 of the models the remaining facts necessary, namely
the dihedral angles, or Pi - the fold angles, is also a "nice" number,
for example arcsin(sqrt(6)/3) and such like.

never mind precisely how i managed to "discover" the nice way of expressing
some of those angles!

but for the "snub cube", which requires two fold angles,
37.01657 degrees (0.64606 radians) and 26.76541 degrees (0.46714 radians)
i cannot come up with nice neat expressions for those constants.

the "snub dodecahedron" is the same - the angles in this case are
15.82463 (0.27619 radians) and 27.07008 (0.47246 radians).

in addition, although i understand how the constraints work to define the
snub cube and snub dodecahedron, i am still looking for a simple way
to create the geometry. all the Platonic solids and the other Archimedean
solids are easy to make by simply expressed "carving" operations.

(i practice with broccoli stalks.)

so i also ask if anyone has seen a recipe for creating these two
perplexing solids by applying simple operations on some original solid.

for example, a cuboctahedron is "simply" a cube with its corners
carved off at angles from the octahdron.

Uninscribable 4-regular polyhedron
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
An Uninscribable 4-Regular Polyhedron

A polyhedron is said to be inscribable if it can be drawn with
all its vertices on the unit sphere, and circumscribable if it
can be drawn with all faces tangent to the unit sphere.  The geometric
operation of polarity replaces one polyhedron by its planar dual,
so that any vertex on the unit sphere is replaced by a dual face tangent
at that point; therefore inscribability and circumscribability are
planar dual concepts of each other.

How can we test inscribability (or equivalently circumscribability)?
Igor Rivin and
Warren Smith
gave a method of transforming the problem into a linear program.  To
test circumscribability, one places weights between 0 and 1/2 on each
edge of the polyhedron, so that the weights on any face add to exactly
one and the weights on any nonfacial cycle add to more than one. If this
can be done, the polyhedron can be circumscribed. The edge weights have
the following interpretation: multiplying each weight by 2pi gives the
angle the edge would take up if viewed from the tangent points on either
adjacent face. Dually, one can inscribe a polyhedron if and only if one
can assign weights so that each vertex's weights add to one and each
nontrivial cut (set of edges that separates two subsets of
vertices) adds to more than one. (The meaning of these weights is harder
to describe for inscription, but it can be related to the dihedral
angles in a related problem of finding "ideal polyhedra" in hyperbolic
geometry.) The existence of such a weighting system can be tested by
applying the ellipsoid method for linear programming. However, it
remains an interesting question whether there exists a more direct
combinatorial method to check inscribability or circumscribability.

We might have more of a chance of finding such a method if we
restrict our attention to special classes of polyhedra. One interesting
special class of polyhedra are the 4-regular ones, in which each
vertex is adjacent to exactly four edges. Since these graphs are
Eulerian (equivalently, their duals are bipartite), every cut has at
least four edges. There is a natural candidate for a Rivin-Smith
weighting on these graphs: just give every edge weight 1/4. This might
fail to work, if there exists a four-edge cut. However, one can then
modify the weights by adding +epsilon and -epsilon alternately along the
edges of an even-length cycle in the graph; this preserves the correct
weights at the vertices, but might improve the weight of a cut. It turns
out that any one cut can be made to have weight greater than one by such
a procedure, so we might hope that repeating this procedure gives a
correct weighting showing that 4-regular polyhedra are always
inscribable. The only problem might be that making one cut have a better
weight always is balanced by making another cut have a worse weight, so
that no correct weighting exists. Can this happen? Yes!




Mike Dillencourt and I formed the example
above by replacing four of
the vertices of a cube by gadgets derived from octahedra. To prove that
this is not inscribable, we need to talk about a concept called
"1-supertoughness". This has a scary name, but is actually a pretty
simple concept: an
n-vertex graph is 1-supertough if, whenever you remove some set
of k vertices, the number of components you have left is at most
k-1.  The example above is not 1-supertough because, if you
remove the four remaining unmodified cube vertices, you get four
components.  What does this have to do with inscribability?  The weights
on the removed vertices must be exactly one each, so the total weight of
the edges between them and the rest of the graph must be exactly
four. However, this means one of the four components must have weight at
most one on the edges connecting it to the removed vertices,
contradicting the assumption that a nontrivial cut has weight more than
one. Therefore no weighting can exist and this polyhedron is not
inscribable.

The following question remains open: is every 1-supertough 4-regular
graph inscribable?

The set of all m-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional projective space
naturally has the structure of Grassmann manifold.  Plucker coordinates are
coordinates for this manifold.  The construction is to note that if a
projective coordinate system is fixed for the n-dimensional projective space,
then an m-dimensional subspace is determined by m+1 independent points x(0), .
. ., x(m).  Each of these points can be considered as an n+1-tuple indexed
from 0 to n (the projective coordinates.)  So for each set of m+1 distinct
integers 0 <= i0 < i1 < . . . < im <= n one can form the determinant

     | x(0)(i0) x(0)(i1)  .  .  .  x(0)(im) |
     | x(1)(i0) x(1)(i1)  .  .  .  x(1)(im) |
     |    .        .      .  .  .      .    |
     |    .        .      .  .  .      .    |
     | x(m)(i0) x(m)(i1)  .  .  .  x(m)(im) |

The tuple of all such determinants (with the canonical ordering) represents
the subspace.  This tuple provides homogeneous coordinates (i.e. two which
differ only by a scalar multiple are identified) which are independent of the
particular choice on independent points in the subspace.  These coordinates
are called Plucker (or Grassmann) coordinates.

The individual components of the Plucker coordinates of a point in this
Grassmann space are not independent - there is the Plucker relation which is
essentially a restatement of expansion by minors.

These were used extensively in the "classical" study of projective algebraic
geometry.  For example it is an immediate consequence of the existence of
Plucker coordinates that the space of lines in projective 3-space can be
identified with a quadric surface in projective 5-space.

Strangely enough I can no longer remember where I learned this stuff and the
only reference I know is

C. Chevalley, Fundamental Concepts of Algebra
Academic Press, 1956.  pp. 201-203

which uses them to parametrize exterior algebras.

Subject:        Re:  Archimedean Solids

Of course it's only  n-gon x n-gon whose squares realise a regular
map - but  n-gon x m-gon is still "Archimedean".

   There are certainly some quite interesting maps among the other
Archimedean polytopes - for instance if you take the polytope

                  3       4       3
               .------O-------O-------.

(the mid-truncation, or  1 1/2 'th ambo version of the 24-cell),
then the cells are truncated cubes, which touch along their
octagonal faces in the twisted way, and you get a nice map of
octagons, 4 to a vertex.

   However, there aren't too many such cases, and I expect they've
already been "mined".  It was only a month or two ago that I re-listed
all the vertex-figures of the archimedean 4-polytopes (not that I
have the list here now, of course), and it's easy to see that not
too many of them include regular skew polygons among the edges of
their vertex figures.  

   I see the English of that got a bit mixed up, since "vertex figures"
was already the subject of the subordinate clause, but you see what I
mean anyway.

   I should imagine that a better way to find examples would be to
first find the maps in abstracto, then do the eigenvalue-type graph
theory to find their embeddings, which might be in quite high-dimensional
spaces.

   For example, letting  1,A,B,C  be the maps that take the typical
vertex of an icosahedron to itself, the sum of its neighbors, the
sum of the neighbors of its antipode, and its antipode, we find:

     A^2 = 5 + 2A + 2B,  BA = 2A + 2B + 5C,  CA = B

so  (A^3 - 2A^2 - 5A) = 2BA = 2A + (A^2-5-2A) + C,   so

No!  error!                 = 4A + 2(A^2-5-2A) + 10C, so

    (A^3 - 4A^2 - 5A + 10) = 10C  if I'm not mistaken, so

    A^4 - 4A^3 - 5A^2 + 10A = 10B = 5A^2 - 10A - 25,  or

      (1,-4,-10,20,25)(A) = 0,  which I factorize:
       1 -5
          1  -5
             -5 25
                -5 25    as  (A-5)(A^3 + A^2 - 5A - 5)

    ie.,   (A-5)(A+1)(A^2-5) = 0

So the eigenvalues of  A  are   5, -1, r5, -r5      (r5 = sqrt(5))

with multiplicities found as    1   5   3    3

   So the icosahedron has 4 irreducible "regular representations",
namely the trivial one, the one in which opposite vertices coincide
to give the vertices of a regular 5-simplex, the standard 3-dimensional
one, and the conjugate 3-dimensional one in which it becomes the
great icosahedron.

     You could now mix these a bit, for instance getting an 8-dimensional
representation by adding a 5 and a 3.  (Since there's a scale parameter
involved, this actually gives a 1-parameter family of such representations.)

    In general, if the permutation character involves k distinct
irreducibles, you get k basic representations this way (which, as in the
above case, may not all be faithful), and then as far as I can see
you can just take any linear combination of them to get the most
general regular embedding.  However, I'm not quite sure what happens
when the character isn't multiplicity-free.  I must work out the
dodecahedron as prototype.

     There is absolutely no hope of giving any reasonable kind of
answer to this question; there is a plethora of possible groups,
and each group has a continuum of orbits, which can lead to a
variety of Voronoi polyhedra.

     Even in the Euclidean case, the problem is not likely to be
solved very soon, although there it's pretty obvious that the
number of combinatorial types is bounded.  There is an example by
Engels of a Voronoi cell that has (I think) 38 faces.

    I don't know, but expect so.  This is not so hopeless - a
counterexample tiling must have certain slightly paradoxical
properties, and it's quite hopeful that one could use these
to disprove its existence, so proving that the invariant must be 0.
On the other hand, of course, if it needn't be, this could of course
be proved by exhibiting just one special tiling.

    The paradoxical nature of the required tiling reminds me of
another problem - that of defining the density of a sphere-packing
in hyperbolic space.  I have read of a "counterexample packing"
of spheres with the following properties:

   i) There are two tilings T1 and T2 of the space into polyhedral
cells that each contain just one of the spheres.

  ii) Each of T1 and T2 admits an automorphism group of isometries
that act transitively on its cells (so that all the cells of  Ti
have the same volume, Vi).

 iii) The volumes  V1 and  V2  are different  (and both finite).

    Does anyone know a reference for this?

I asked a bit too generally, but what can be said to characterize 
such polyhedra? I'm more interested in the case where the quotient 
is a manifold. Can one recover the manifold or even the center from 
a polyhedron? What can be said about the elements of the 
fundamental group which are represented as faces?

I suppose the higher-genus and really small ones wouldn't work. The
only way I know of getting arbitrarily small polyhedra which tile 
is by tiling the gap between two horospheres. Are there essentially 
different tilings?

Well, I just typed out what I was trying to make work, but I think
I just found a counterexample:

Consider the (x,y,z+) upper-half plane model and the convex hull
of the vertices (+-1,+-1,2), (+-1,+-1,1), (0,+-1,1), (+-1,0,1), and
(0,0,1). In other words, a 2x2 square in the height 2 horosphere
and 4 1x1 squares in the height 1 horosphere. Of course, the top 
square is congruent to the bottom squares. By translations in 2Zx2Z,
this shape tiles a region around the horosphere of height 2. This
region is congruent to regions around the horospheres of height 2^n
for all integers n; these tile H^3.

Now, this shape probably doesn't have Dehn invariant 0. But even if
it does, a small polygonal bump added to the top allows the same 
bump to be taken 4 times out of the bottom. So, choose the bump
to have nonzero Dehn invariant D, and the new shape will have Dehn
invariant -3D.

I hope the above works, but I've been up for some time so I actually
can't see it.

For foams in H^2 and H^3, I didn't find anything I could compute. 
What happens if you take the lim sup of the density within balls 
of increasing radius centered about each point p to get a function 
of p, and then iterate using the average value instead of density?

That is disturbing if the spheres are in any way symmetric or 
fairly large in comparison to V1 and V2. Otherwise, it still 
disturbs me, but I suspect that frequently there exists a matching 
between the sets of tiles of two tilings given that the tiles have 
large diameter with respect to the ratio of their volumes, where a 
tile of T1 is adjacent to a tile of T2 iff their intersection 
contains a ball of radius r.

...which suggests several questions:

1) Where does this specific word-problem come from?  Perhaps trying to
prove that no rectangle of odd area can be tiled with L-triominos if
only two orientations (related by 180-degree rotation) are allowed?

2) Now that we have a group-theoretic proof, is there an elementary
proof of the same result about tilings?  Note that if all four orientations
(or even three of the four orientations) are allowed then a 5x9 rectangle
can be tiled with L-triominos.

3) How did David Sibley find the two premutations above?  Could they
be affine linear transformations on a 5-dimensional vector space over
Z/2?  The cycle structures (4)(4)(12)(12) of both A and B are compatible
with this guess.

The group  G = < a, b : a^2*b^2=(b*a)^2, b^2*a^2=(a*b)^2 >  is soluble:

Let  K  be the subgroup generated by  p = a*b  and  q = b*a .
This subgroup is normal,  with quotient  G/K  cyclic
(NB:  p^a = q,  p^b = p^-1*q^2,  q^a = q^-1*p^2,  &  q^b = p ).

Let  L  be the subgroup generated by  u = p^3  and  v = q^3 .
This subgroup too is normal (with  u^a = v = u^b  and  v^a = u = v^b ),
and also Abelian (since in fact both p and q centralize both u and v).

Further, the quotient  K/L  is a homomorphic image of the (3,3,3) triangle
group  < p, q : p^3 = q^3 = (p*q)^3 = 1 >,  which is Abelian-by-cyclic,
and is therefore soluble.

Now since  G/K is cyclic,  K/L is soluble,  and  L is Abelian, 
it follows that  G itself is soluble.

Here's a finite matrix representation of  G  over GF(2):

  A = [ 0  1  0  0  0 ]            B = [ 1  0  1  1  0 ]
      [ 0  0  1  0  0 ]                [ 0  0  1  0  0 ]

      [ 0  0  0  0  1 ]                [ 0  0  0  0  1 ]

  A^3*B^3 = [ 0  1  1  1  0 ]      B^3*A^3 = [ 0  1  1  1  0 ]
            [ 1  0  1  1  0 ]                [ 1  0  1  1  0 ]
            [ 1  1  0  1  0 ]                [ 1  1  0  1  0 ]
            [ 1  1  1  0  0 ]                [ 1  1  1  0  0 ]
            [ 0  0  0  1  1 ]                [ 1  1  1  0  1 ]

  (A^3*B^3)^2 = (B^3*A^3)^2 = [ 1  0  0  0  0 ]
                              [ 0  1  0  0  0 ]
                              [ 0  0  1  0  0 ]
                              [ 0  0  0  1  0 ] 
                              [ 1  1  1  1  1 ] 
							  
These matrices generate a factor group of order 96, with centre of order 2,
and clearly isomorphic to a subgroup of AGL(4,2).

This is the problem the word-problem comes from:

                   1
                  1 1
                 2 2 3

                                                            o
This figure shows that you can tile a triangle T9 with T2: o o

QUESTION: which T(n) can be tiled with T2?

SOLUTION:
 The number of points of T(n) is ( n+1 \choose 2 ) = t(n).
 3 | t(n)  iff  n = 0, 2 (mod 3).

 CASE I: if n = 0, 2, 9, 11 (mod 12) then T(n) is tileable.
   From T9 you can get T11 and T12 adding:

      1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1
     1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1

   or
      1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2
     2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1
    2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1

   With T11, T12, and k times

     1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2

   you can construct T(n+12) from T(n).

 CASE II: if n = 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 12) then T(n) is not tileable.
   This is the hard case. You can look at the equivalent triomino
   puzzle. In this case T5 would look like:

              o                The allowed L-triominoes are:
            o o                      o         o o
          o o o   = T5             o o   and   o
        o o o o
      o o o o o                (only 180-degree rotation)

   Now let's try group theory:
   You can read about this technique in the article:
     Dmitry V. Fomin, Getting it together with "polyominoes",
     quantum 2:2 (Nov/Dec 1991) 20-23, 61
   So you get the group: G = < a, b| aabb=baba, bbaa=abab >.
   If a^n b^n <> (ba)^n for n = 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 12) then is T(n) not
   tileable. Is a^n b^n = (ba)^n for some n = 3, 5, 6, 8 (mod 12) then
   a^3 b^3 = (ba)^3. This you can see be the same technique as in CASE I.
   You have the additional possibility of reduction in the group. If you
   show a^3 b^3 <> (ba)^3 then CASE II is solved. David Sibley found a
   homomorphism, which shows this inequality. So CASE II is proofed.

Annotation:
  Noam Elkies is right, that the homomorphis of David Sibley shows that
  it is implossible to tile an odd rectangle with the L-triomino (only
  180-degree rotation allowed) too. In this case you have to show that
  a^3 b <> b a^3.

Coloring Line Arrangements
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Coloring Line Arrangements

If one places an arrangement of lines in the plane, it forms a graph in
which the vertices correspond to places where two or more lines cross
and the edges correspond to the line segments connecting the vertices.
How many colors do we need to color such a graph?

As it turns out, there are several different versions of the problem,
depending on our assumptions.  Is the arrangement simple
(containing no three lines that meet at a single point)?
Do we count as edges the connections that wrap around "through infinity"
connecting the first and last crossings on each line?
We might also ask whether we allow parallel lines or not, but unlike the
previous two questions this does not seem to be important in determining
the chromatic number of line arrangements.

Simple arrangements without wraparound

We first consider the graphs arising from simple arrangements, in which
we do not allow wraparound edges.  In this case a simple greedy algorithm
shows that the chromatic number is at most three.  We can assume (by
rotating the arrangement if necessary) that no line is vertical.
Then simply color the vertices from left to right.  Each vertex
has at most two neighbors already colored, so one of three colors is always available.
It is also easy to construct arrangements requiring three colors.

Non-simple arrangements without wraparound

Without wraparound, a planar line arrangement forms a planar graph,
so the four-color theorem tells us its chromatic number is at most four.
The following example shows that four colors are sometimes needed
(the arrangement contains other intersections outside the ones shown, that are not necessary to determine the chromatic number):



Simple arrangements with wraparound

Wrapping edges "through infinity" to connect the first and last vertices on each line causes some complications in coloring the arrangement.  The resulting graph is no longer planar: if we tried to draw the wrapped around connections we would find that
they cross each other.  Instead the arrangement lives on a surface other
than the usual Euclidean plane, known as the "projective plane", which
differs somewhat in its properties.  For instance the four-color theorem
does not apply to projective-planar graphs; instead they may require up
to five colors.  However only four colors are needed for simple
arrangements with wraparound.

To see this, note that any simple arrangement forms a graph in which
each vertex has exactly four neighbors.  A well-known result in graph
theory (Brooks' theorem) states that if the vertices in a graph have at
most k neighbors, and the graph is neither complete nor an odd
cycle, then the graph is k-colorable.
In our case, an odd cycle clearly has fewer than four neighbors per vertex,
so the only other problem case would be the complete graph K5.
And although K5 can be embedded on the projective plane
(one embedding is shown below) it can not come from a line arrangement, since
its does not have a triangular number of vertices.
(A simple n-line arrangement has exactly n(n-1)/2 vertices.)



So Brooks' theorem tells us that four colors suffice to color simple
arrangements with wraparound.
The following example shows a matching lower bound: at least four colors
may be required.



Non-simple arrangements with wraparound

Any graph in the projective plane can be colored with at most six colors.
(One relatively easy way to see this is to use
Euler's formula
to show that there exists a vertex of degree at most five; therefore one
can remove that vertex, color the remaining graph recursively, and then add the vertex
back with at least one color available to color it.)
And some projective-planar graphs, for instance, the following
complete graph on six vertices, require six colors.



This graph's vertices have odd numbers of neighbors so it does not come
from a line arrangement.
The following example (known in projective
geometry as the "complete quadrangle") shows that five colors may sometimes be
needed for the graphs coming fromline arrangements.  The three outer
vertices and the center one are all connected
to each other, and so require four different colors.  The remaining
three vertices are each connected to these four and require a fifth
color.



We now sketch a proof that five colors are always sufficient.
A line arrangement always has a degree-four vertex (Sylvester's theorem);
this can be seen by applying 
Euler's formula
to show that there exists a vertex of degree at most five, but then observing
that all vertex degrees are even.  So, let v be such a vertex,
contained on line L.

Form a graph G by collapsing all vertices on line L into a single point;
then G is a planar graph.  More technically, L can be assumed to be the "line
at infinity" of the projective plane, and the collapse of L produces the
"one-point completion" of the Euclidean plane, which is just a sphere,
and graphs embedded on the sphere are always planar.  So by the
four-color theorem G can be colored with at most four colors.

If we
undo the collapse, to get back to the line arrangement we're interested
in coloring, then everything on L will be colored the same color, say red, L will have
no red neighbors, and the rest of the arrangement will be colored ok.
We now recolor the vertices on L to make a five-coloring of the whole arrangement.
Because we've only used four colors so far, one color, say blue, is still unused.
The vertices on L form a cycle, which can be thought of as a path
connected at its endpoints by the special vertex v.  We simply change
the color of every other vertex on that path from red to blue.
Finally, we need to choose a color for v.  If L has an odd number of vertices,
one neighbor of v on L might be red and one might be blue.
But only two of the three remaining colors can be used by the other two
neighbors of v, so there is always some color
available to color v and complete
the five-coloring of the arrangement.

Summary

We have described coloring problems for simple and non-simple line arrangements,
with and without edges that wrap around through infinity.
Simple arrangements without wraparound have chromatic number three.
Non-simple arrangements without wraparound have chromatic number four.
Simple arrangements with wraparound have chromatic number four.
And non-simple arrangements with wraparound have chromatic number five.

Subject:        Kelvin Conjecture Overthrown

I received the following email from Ken Brakke:

I've got some news from the wonderful world of soap bubbles
that I'd like to publicize on the Geometry Forum.
Here's the news:

A long-standing conjecture about soap bubbles has been overthrown.
In 1887, Lord Kelvin pondered how to partition space into cells
of equal volume with the least area of surface between them, i.e.
the most efficient soap bubble froth.  He came up with a 14-sided
space-filling polyhedron with 6 square sides and 8 hexagonal sides.
The faces have to curve a bit where they meet to form the proper
soap film angles.  Now Denis Weaire (dweaire@vax1.tcd.ie) and
Robert Phelan (rphelan@alice.phy.tcd.ie) of Trinity College, Dublin,
have beaten Kelvin.  The Weaire-Phelan structure uses
two kinds of cells, a dodecahedron and a tetrakaidecahedron
with 2 hexagons and 12 pentagons.  The surface area is 0.3% less
than the Kelvin structure, which is a whopping big amount to all
of us who have tried to beat Kelvin over the years.

The Weaire-Phelan structure has cubic symmetry, and the fundamental
region is a 2x2x2 cube.  The 8 cells start as Voronoi cells on centers

                0   0   0
                1   1   1
                0.5 0   1
                1.5 0   1
                0   1   0.5
                0   1   1.5
                1   0.5 0
                1   1.5 0

There are two dodecahedra (centered at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1)) and six
tetrakaidecahedra. The cells must be adjusted a bit to get exactly equal
volumes, and the faces must curve a bit to get the proper soap film angles.
The tetrakaidecahedra stack on their hexagonal faces to form three sets
of perpendicular interlocking columns, with the interstices filled
by the dodecahedra.

In 1977, the Hungarian mathematician Lajos Szilassi found a way to 
construct a seven sided toroidal polyhedron.  Each face of his
polyhedron is a hexagon (none of them is a regular hexagon).  The 
polyhedron shares with the tetrahedron the property that each of 
its faces touches all the other faces.  A tetrahedron demonstrates
that four colors are necessary for a map on a surface topologically
equivalent to a sphere; the Szilassi polyhedron demonstrates that 
seven colors are necessary for a map on a surface topologically
equivalent to a torus.  (Neither polyhedron demonstrates anything 
about how many colors are sufficient.)
 
tetrahedron:            4 faces     4 vertices     6 edges    0 holes
Szilassi polyhedron:    7 faces    14 vertices    21 edges    1 hole
 
What other kinds of polyhedron could have the property that each pair
of faces shares an edge?  Probably none.  Euler's formula f + v - e = 2
is easily generalized for polyhedra with one or more holes; if h is the
number of holes, f + v - e = 2 - 2*h.  
 
In a polyhedron every pair of whose faces shares an edge, f and e are 
related by the equation e = f * (f - 1) / 2.  
 
In a polyhedron every pair of whose faces shares an edge, each vertex 
must be at the intersection of three edges.  (If there were more than 
three, some of the faces couldn't share an edge.)  Thus, as each edge 
connects two vertices, v = e * 2 / 3.
 
Combining the above equations and simplifying gives 
 
    h = (f*f - 7*f + 12) / 12
 
which can be factored as
 
    h = (f - 4) * (f - 3) / 12
 
..  Only certain values of f yield whole numbers of holes.  f=4 applies
to the tetrahedron; f=7 applies to the Szilassi polyhedron.  The next
value of f that yields a whole value for h is 12, which would apply to 
a polyhedron with 12 faces, 66 edges, 44 vertices, and 6 holes.  I find
it inconceivable that such a polyhedron could exist, and higher values 
of f and h seem even less likely.  Obviously I'm a bit short of a 
rigorous proof, but you get the picture.

Szilassi gave a set of equations that describe a particular instance of
7-sided toroidal polyhedron; Martin Gardner reproduced patterns for the
faces in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American (Nov. 1978).

If any of this interests you, and in particular if you would like 
patterns for making models of a Szilassi polyhedron, let me know.  
I have software I'd be glad to share which lets you play around 
with the angles and proportions of the polyhedron.

If you exchange faces and vertices, this is the inverse of a torus with
7 vertices, 21 edges and 14 faces.  

To find polyhedra with each face sharing an edge one can invert polyhedra
with each vertex sharing an edge.  

Looking for polyhedra with each vertex sharing an edge, this 
is combinatorially satisfied by a polyhedron with 9 vertices,
36 edges and 24 faces with Euler characteristic -3 -- it is non-orientable.
This looks like:

Yes; nice one!  I have one here in my hand, in fact, this very second. It was
made and and given to me by my late colleague Derrick Breach,  who alas died
suddenly the other day.  He also constructed what's been said to be one of
the world's most complete sets of (cardboard) solids - regular, Archimedean, 
Johnson, stellated, compound, and many many others.  Anyone who likes can see 
them on display here at Canterbury NZ - perhaps on your way through while 
collecting your chocolate fish credits!      Derrick will be sorely missed.

But getting back to the Szilassi polyhedron - it's very nice.  The faces
come in three pairs of congruents, and another; so the whole thing has a 
neat skew-symmetry.  The six paired faces are all nonconvex hexagons, and
the other one is convex and almost regular - it's a rectangle with two
opposite truncated corners on my model, though I might guess it could be
made regular by distorting the others a bit more.     Cool.

Oh great.  Give it a whirl, Tom, and tell us if that one can be made regular.

Yes, the whole Heawood formula thing is fascinating, both mathematically
and historically.  When Kempe produced his false proof of the 4-color
theorem, (ca 1886), it took a year for someone to notice it was wrong.
That someone was Heawood, and ironically, the very paper where he announced
the error, contained his formula, which was given as an equation, ALSO in error!
(He'd in fact proved an inequality, but didn't notice his logical lacuna.)

It took all of TEN (!) years for someone to notice THIS error. It was Tietche,
who proved the equation correctly, produced examples for up to (I think) 6
holes, and extended it to non-orientable surfaces.  As far as I know there
was no actual error in *his* paper - but:  The Heawood formula, though then
known to be correct, was still only known to be applicable as a sufficient
but NOT necessary bound on the number of colors - there could not be MORE
than the Heawood number of colors required, but there may be less.  The Tietche
paper with examples, tended (by silence) to imply it was nec & suff. Finally,
in 1930 odd, Franklin proved that the Klein bottle, though having Heawood number
7, in fact only ever required 6 colors.  This paper is very easy to follow,
and a tour-de-force in simple chromatic combinatorics.

There were NO errors, even implied, in the Franklin paper.  But oddly, it led
to an error in mathemnatical folklore!  Thuswise.  Because the Klein exception
was the only one known for so long, it became "well-known" that the Heawood
formula had been proved nec-&-suff for ALL other cases.  This was mentioned
to me by my own lecturer as fact, in fact; I recall it very well. That was in
1965, when in fact it was NOT YET KNOWN to be so!  (My old lecturer is still
here on the staff with me - I never fail to remind him of this gaff when
appropriate!  :)  )  It wasn't completely proved till Ringel & Young tidied
it all up in a series of papers in the late 60's.   Klein is the sole oddity!

Phew!!

Yes; I took years of odd moments of time, constructing my own dodecahedral
holocontiguous hexatoroidal map.   Great fun.   Later I found a fun way to
construct new maps from olds, using man-machine interaction.  As always,
of course, the real fun was in the programming rather than the results.

One other thing I *did* do by hand, though, was to find a fully symmetric map
of this type.  It's neatly modellable on either a dodecahedron with 6 (bent)
tubes going between opposite faces, or a cube with six tubes going between
opposite edges.  Way cool!  I have models in my office if anyone wants to see.

|>   I find it inconceivable that such a polyhedron could exist,

(For those who've forgotten what I'm waffling about, Tom means a polyhedron with
 12 (possibly nonconvex) faces, all touching all, with Euler characteristic -10.)

I would have said so too, once.  

However, the existence & shape of the Szilassi polyhedron, combined with my 
own fully symmetric simple-tube model, now suggests to me that it may well be
possible!   Maybe I'll try and construct it one day, and earn undying fame...

I haven't had any luck making that one convex face a regular hexagon.
In Szilassi's original, it has 180-degree rotational symmetry and looks 
about like this:

David,

Hi there.  Your page at 
  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/szilassi.html
(which I found from a link on your page at 
  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/polytope.html
) has a copy of a sci.math posting I'd made several years ago
about the Szilassi poyhedron, and several follow-up postings.

Since then, I've changed my email address, and put up a web page
about the Szilassi poyhedron at 
  http://www.qnet.com/~crux/szilassi.html
which is an updated version of the topic I'd originally brought
up in sci.math, with illustrations.  If you're willing to add to 
a link on your site to my Szilassi page, I'd be grateful.  As it 
is now, anyone trying to contact me at the old address given on 
your page (e.g., to get a copy of my Szilassi polyhedron software) 
won't find me.

In any case, thanks for your web site, I've enjoyed reading it.

regards,

QTVR and Mathematical Visualization
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Quicktime VR and Mathematical Visualization

Many mathematical constructions, particularly in geometry, can be
understood more easily if some form of animation or motion is displayed.
Animated GIFs, MPEG, and Quicktime are popular formats for simple animations,
but do not allow for interaction.

The three most common methods for interactive display of three
dimensional objects on the web seem to be
the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML),
Apple's Quicktime VR (QTVR),
and Java.  All can be used with Netscape or other browsers on both
Windows and Mac platforms; Java also works on Unix machines but the
other two apparently do not.  VRML represents three-dimensional objects
directly, with an interface allowing the objects and point of view to
both move, but is limited to displaying only three dimensional Euclidean
space and (because it must be rendered in realtime) can only do certain
primitive types of rendering.  Since Java is a programming language, it
can (theoretical) display anything, and its user interface controls need
not correspond directly to camera motion; its limits are set by
programmer competence and the same realtime rendering problem that
besets VRML.  QTVR objects are formed simply from a set of precomputed
image frames, so it is as unlimited as Java in the types of object it
can display, it doesn't require as much programming effort, and it also
avoids the realtime rendering bottleneck of the other two methods.
QTVR's user interface only provides for two degrees of freedom but those
degrees of freedom can like Java be used to control any parameter, not
just camera motion.  Therefore QTVR seems the most flexible option for
mathematical visualizations requiring only limited user interaction.
(QTVR also excels in viewing photographic or photographic-quality images
such as fashion modeling, landscapes, and architectural walkthroughs.)
However, QTVR's bandwidth requirements are typically much higher than
the other methods.

Herewith my efforts in the use of QTVR
for mathematical visualization.



Box in a Box

This exercise illustrates the solution to a problem
posed on sci.math by Carl Parkes:
what is the smallest cube that can be put inside another cube
touching all the faces?  Or equivalently what is the largest cube
that can circumscribe another cube in such a way that all its faces are
touched.  In my solution, the inner cube is scaled by a factor of 3/5
from the outer, and is rotated 60 degrees along the main diagonal.
If the outer cube is the unit cube [0,1]3, the inner cube's
vertex coordinates are all integer multiples of 1/5.

Originally, as with most of my geometry junkyard entries, I illustrated
this with a line drawing made in Adobe Illustrator (also using Adobe
Dimensions to help with the 3d orthogonal perspective; for more
complicated drawings I use Mathematica or POV-Ray for perspective help):


Adobe Illustrator line drawing:

postscript source

Later, I redid this drawing as a raytraced rendering.
Some of the complications here included making the outer box look
transparent, but not distorting the inner box's shape, and still making it
possible to visualize the outer shape. I used POV-Ray's glass texture,
modified to turn off refraction, increase surface roughness, and
decrease the amount of specular reflection.  The image size is about 2/3 that
of the original line art, and to the eye looks even smaller (more like
1/2 the size); the more realistic rendering helps make up for the
loss in size, but the animated GIF's constant motion is distracting.
The QTVR version has better color resolution than the GIF, allows for a
greater variety of viewpoints, and allows
the user to understand the shape better by controlling the direction
from which it is viewed.

smoothness of rotation.
Vertical camera angle ranges from 0 to 66 degrees (20 degrees for the GIF).
Because of the symmetry of the configuration, rendering only needed to be
done through a 120 degree horizontal rotation, saving a factor of 3 in
file size and rendering time.
Even so, the 240 frames in the full QTVR object use 4MB of storage
and took 6 1/2 hours to render on a 200MHz PowerPC 603.
This was my first QTVR project, and my first animated GIF, so I spent a
lot of time trying different image compression options, color maps, and
so on, finally settling on dithering for the GIF and JPEG compression
(100% quality) for the
QTVR frames. Lower quality JPEGs were smaller but made
the inner cube's edges blurry; ConvertToMovie's "Graphics" option was my
second choice for QTVR image format.

Labyrinth Tiling
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Labyrinth Tiling

Many
tilings,
including the famous
Penrose tiling,
are generated by a subdivision process of the following sort:
starting with a single tile from a given finite set, repeatedly
replace each tile by a collection of smaller tiles, drawn from the same set.
For instance, starting with a square, and repeatedly dividing each square into four,
produces the standard square tiling by a process closely related to the construction
of the
quadtree
geometric data structure.

Another subdivision tiling can be formed by tiles of two types:
equilateral triangles, and 30-30-120 isosceles triangles.
The equilateral triangle can be subdivided into three congruent isosceles triangles
by connecting each vertex to the center of the triangle.  And the isosceles triangle
can be subdivided into two similar isosceles triangles and an
equilateral triangle, all three having the same area, by trisecting its
hypotenuse and connecting the resulting points to the opposite vertex.
The following image shows several levels of this subdivision process,
with the triangles at each level scaled to have the same area.



Repeating this subdivision and scaling process produces an infinite
tiling of the plane (or actually a family of different tilings) which
I call the "labyrinth tilings" for reasons to
be made clear below.



At first glance, this tiling looks quite uniform: it is formed by a
regular pattern of 60-120 rhombuses, each subdivided by a diagonal into
two triangles.  The only variation occurs in the choice of which diagonal to use.
Nevertheless we will see that this tiling has quite an interesting
aperiodic structure.

Position Coding

For many aperiodic tilings, one can prove aperiodicity by considering
the ratios in which the different kinds of tiles are used.  If these
ratios are irrational, the tiling is aperiodic.  For instance
the occurrence in the Penrose tiling of the golden ratio shows that it
is aperiodic.  Unfortunately, this does not work for our labyrinth
tilings: the isosceles and equilateral triangles occur in the ratio 3:1.
We need to prove aperiodicity a different way.  We will do so using a
method for using certain sequences to encode the positions of triangles
in the tiling.

Note that from any step k in the subdivision process that forms the tiling,
there is only one way of reversing the process and recovering the tiling
at step k-1.  For, any equilateral triangle at step k must
have exactly two isosceles neighbors (and one equilateral neighbor);
this equilateral triangle and pair of isosceles neighbors forms a larger
isosceles triangle at step k-1.  The remaining isosceles
triangles form triples meeting at their obtuse angles, which form larger
equilateral triangles at step k-1.  From the triangles at step k-1
we can recover those at step k-2, and so on.



Define the position code of each triangle in a labyrinth tiling
to be the infinite sequence of shapes and orientations of these larger and larger
triangles at previous levels of the subdivision.

The position code of a single triangle determines the arrangement of
triangles in all neighborhoods of the triangle, and therefore determines
the overall labyrinth tiling.
Two triangles belong to the same tiling when their position codes
differ in only a finite number of places.
(There are also some cases when two points separated by an infinite ray
of a tiling can have position codes differing in infinitely many places.)

The existence of these position codes shows that any labyrinth tiling is aperiodic.
For, any point in the triangle belongs to a unique triangle at any previous level
j<k of the subdivision process.  In particular we can choose
j so that the triangle is larger than any given period of
translational symmetry.  No point within this large triangle can be
taken to any other point in the triangle by a translational symmetry.
So no such symmetry can exist, and the tiling is aperiodic.  (Note that,
just as in the case of the Penrose tilings, a finite number of
rotational symmetries may still exist).

Labyrinths

The edges in the labyrinth tilings lie at six different slopes,
at 30 degree angles to each other.  If we look at only those edges which
are horizontal or vertical, an interesting pattern emerges.



These edges seem to mark out the boundaries of a
space-filling labyrinth that covers the entire plane.
(The labyrinths of the ancients, unlike modern mazes, were typically
unicursal, having
neither branches nor dead ends [Phillips].)
Because of the tiling's six-fold symmetry, this labyrinth is overlaid
with two others, at 30 and 60 degree angles to it.

These patterns can be explained using position codes.
It turns out that,
given any two points in the tiling, either
an infinite horizontal or vertical ray in the tiling crosses the line
segment between them, or there is a unique sequence of triangles that forms a path
connecting them and is not crossed by any horizontal or vertical edges.

To prove this, look at the position codes of the two points.
Eventually the large triangles in the codes get so large that there is
only room for two possible configurations: either the two points are in
a single large triangle, or they are in two adjacent triangles.

If the two points are in adjacent triangles at all the infinitely many levels
of the position codes, and if those triangles are always separated by a
horizontal or vertical segment, then these segments combine to form an
infinite horizontal or vertical ray or line.  In this case, this line
may separate the points from each other.

Otherwise, at some level j
of the subdivision process, the path we are looking for connecting the two points
consists simply of these one or two triangles from the position codes of
the two points.
We now show that each level of the subdivision process preserves the
existence of these paths.  To do this, we use a slightly modified version of the
subdivision process that ends up tiling a larger area than the original triangles.
At each step, we follow the usual subdivisions described above, except that
if the resulting area has an isosceles triangle hypotenuse on its boundary that
is neither vertical nor horizontal, we add the matching triangle on the
other side of that edge.  Because of this addition, all isosceles
triangles with slanted hypotenuses can be assumed to form matched pairs.



As can be seen above, if before the subdivision a set of triangles is
crossed by a path of triangles (connected to each other by slanted edges),
a modified version of the same path will wind through the same region
after the subdivision.  Therefore there is a single
path covering a region surrounding the two given points, which produces the unique path connecting the points that I claimed existed.

I assume you actually mean: the four vertices of the smaller rectangle are 
strictly interior to the sides of the larger rectangle (to rule out 
"solutions" like cutting the square in half and making the two rectangles 
coincide).

Draw the square, divided horizontally into two rectangles S (the smaller 
one) and L (the larger one).  Let S1 be a copy of S, inscribed in L, and 
look at the two vertices p and q of S1 that are on opposite vertical sides 
of the square.  Then p and q differ horizontally by the side of the square, 
and have Euclidean distance equal to the diagonal of S, so one can place 
another copy S2 of S, with horizontal and vertical sides, sharing the same 
two vertices p and q.

Now S2 is placed symmetrically in L, so it divides L into pieces in some 
proportion b:a:b, where a is the side length of S.  Thus the horizontal 
edges of S and S2 together divide the square in the proportion a:b:a:b.  In 
particular, one of p and q is on the midpoint of its square edge.

Consider the four triangles at the corners of L, cut off by the edges of 
S1.  They are similar right triangles, and the larger of the two has 
hypotenuse equal to the square's side and one side equal to half the 
square's side.  So they are 30-60-90 right triangles.

From this one can calculate in turn the lengths of the remaining side of 
the large triangle, the short side of the small triangle, and the 
hypotenuse of the small triangle, concluding that the width of S is 
(2-sqrt(3)) times the width of the square, and that the width of L is 
(1+sqrt(3)) times the width of the square.

I didn't need any surds (in the inbetween computation) at all - 
here is how I did it:

First I generalized: Start not with a square but with a
rectangle 1*(a+b) and cut it into 1*a and 1*b (a<b).
(So you can add questions# like "When does the 1*a inscribe
into the 1*b and that in the 1*(a+b)", which is also
interesting). I just handle a<1, but a>1 gives another
diagram.
When you cut out the 1*a from the 1*b, two pairs of similar
triangles 1:x:y=a:1-y:b-x remain. Together with one Pythagoras you 
immediately get x=(b-a)/(1-a**2),y=(1-ab)/(1-a**2),
(1-a**2)**2-(1-ab)**2=(b-a)**2. You can divide this by (a-b)
(the "super anal retentive degenerate case" :-) to get
b=a*(3-a**2)/(1+a**2). a+b=1 now gives the 2-V3 solution.

# When is...one of the three rectangles similar to another...
one of them a square...b maximal...and so on :-)

This is kind of interesting, actually. I kept bogging down
when I tried to set it up brute force, and I finally hit
on the following which turns out pretty slick:

If you circumscribe a rectangle about another rectangle
with sides touching the corners and making angles theta
and (90-theta) with the original sides, the sides of the
circumscribed rectangle will have length given by:

K' = C*L + S*K
L' = S*L + C*K

... in terms of the given sides K and L
( C and S are cos and sin of theta .)

If we want the rectangles to be the pieces of a square
formed by a cut parallel to a side, we have the requirement
L' = L, K' = L-K . Then we have the equations:

(C-1)*L + (S+1)*K = 0
(S-1)*L +   C  *K = 0

... and we must have C*(C-1) + ( 1 - S^2 ) = 0 = C*(2*C - 1 )
so C= 1/2 and S = sqrt(3)/2 and K = (2-sqrt(3))*L ~= 0.268 * L
( Passes a sanity check with paper and scissors. )

I think a non-square AxB rectangle inscribes
in a CxD rectangle when:

((C+D)/(A+B))^2 + ((C-D)/(A-B))^2 = 2

and  C + D > A+B.

(suppose AxB is placed at an angle Theta
to the coordinate axes, so that its projections
on the axes are of length C and D. the
squared expressions are sin+cos and
sin-cos  of Theta.)

Dilation-Free Planar Graphs

Dilation-Free Planar Graphs

Suppose you've been hired to lay out the buildings of a college campus.  
College students are disrespectful of authority (at least, of campus 
planners) and will cut new paths through the campus lawns between any 
buildings not already directly connected by paths.  So will the faculty.  
But then, wherever two paths meet, some entrepreneur is likely to place a 
coffee stand.  This new coffee stand will attract students, who will form 
paths from it to all campus buildings, etc.  Before long, your campus will 
be all covered by paths, with no lawn left.  Or will it?  How can you lay 
out your campus so that all buildings are already directly connected by 
paths, without forming crossroads and encouraging coffee-stand builders?

We can express this problem using the notion of dilation.  
The dilation of a pair of vertices in an embedded planar graph is the 
ratio between two kinds of distance: the length of the shortest path 
between them in the graph, and their geometric distance.  The dilation 
of the graph is the maximum dilation of any two of its vertices.  A graph 
has dilation one if and only if there is a direct path between each pair 
of vertices.  Which graphs can have dilation one?

The pattern of solutions is common to many areas of mathematics: there 
are several infinite families of solutions, together with a few isolated 
special cases.  Actually, here there is exactly one special case.
First, the infinite families.  Note that, if there are five or more 
vertices in the graph, some path must have two or more edges (there is no 
way to find a planar embedding of a five-vertex graph in which each vertex 
is connected to each other by a single edge).  Let P denote the path 
having the most vertices; then there are four infinite families:

1. All vertices are on P:2. One vertex is not on P:3. Two vertices are on opposite sides of P; the path between them 
passes through a vertex on P:4. Two vertices are on opposite sides of the line through P; the edge 
between them misses P:

However, there is one more case:
the graph can consist of a triangle nested inside another triangle, with 
three two-edge paths formed by two inner vertices and one outer vertex.



The proof that these are the only possibilities is a straightforward 
case analysis.  If there is at most one point on either side of P, the 
graph is in one of the four infinite families.  Otherwise, there are some 
two points x and y on the same side of P.  If line xy passes through 
an endpoint of P, we can form a subset of the graph in which five points 
form a vee.  But then, four of the points form a crossroads from which we 
can find a smaller vee, leading to an infinite regress.  If line xy misses 
any vertex of P, we can form a crossroads between x, y, and two points of P, 
again forming a vee and an infinite regress.  So, the only remaining case 
is that P has only three points, and that line xy passes through the middle 
point, forming a tee.  If this is not in one of our infinite families, 
there must be a further point z on one side or the other of xy, and the 
same analysis shows that z must be one endpoint of a line through an 
endpoint of P and the middle point of the path containing x and y.  These 
points together form the irregular case above, and it is not hard to see 
that any additional points would lead to an infinite regress.

Does a non-trivial knot in R^3 necessarily have four collinear points?

I now know the status of this question.  The answer is yes for knots
in general position, where general position means everything but a closed
set of measure zero in various reasonable spaces of knot embeddings.
This was proved in a paper by Morton and Mond in 1980.  As often happens,
however, someone else had the same basic ideas in 1933.

I can prove the statement for all C^1 knots, which I think suffices in this
context in which this question arose.  I'm still interested in the general
case, especially for wild knots.

Here is why a knot must have three collinear points:  Suppose that for
a point P there does not exist Q and R collinear with it on the knot.
Then for every point Q, we may join P and Q by a chord, and the union
of the chords is evidently an embedded disk with the knot as boundary.
Therefore the knot is trivial.

Let us define a hoop in R^3 to be any set in R^3 that is
isometric to the unit circle { (x,y,0) in R^3 | x^2 + y^2 = 1 }.

Denote the open ball of radius r about the origin by B(r).

Let X be a subset of R^3 which is a disjoint union of hoops.
Let us call such a set "hooped."  If X is also a measurable
set, we define the volume fraction vf(X) as follows:
	
	vf(X) =  lim    ( vol(X intersect B(r)) / vol(B(r)) )
	        r -> oo	 

when this limit exists.  It is easy to see that vf(X) does not
depend on the location of the origin. 

Define the packing fraction for hoops in R^3 to be the number

		pf = sup( vf(X) ) 

where the sup is over all hooped measurable sets X in R^3 for
which vf exists.

QUESTION:	Does anyone know of any results on determining
the packing fraction for hoops in R^3 ?  

(I have found that it is over 70 percent.)

Buckyballs (née Truncated Icosahedra)

The truncated icosahedron is, of course, one of the standard
Archimedean polyhedra.
However, it and related shapes were popularized first by Buckminster
Fuller's geodesic domes, by its use in the design of soccer balls, and
then more recently by the discovery of
Carbon molecules in this shape.  The molecules were named
Buckminsterfullerene, or buckyballs
for short, and since then the name has attached itself to the geometric
shape as well.

Subject:        Delauney triangulation and points of intersections of lines

I've been building a method for resample pixel data which uses
the Delauney triangulation of a set of points, but I have
not been able to prove that it will work properly in a
general case and I'd be interested if anyone could point
me to appropriate references.

The Delauney triangulation (i.e., the creation of triangular tiles
with vertices at each of the points which cover the region in
which the points are contained) has the property that
the circumscribing circle for each triangle contains no
other vertices of the triangulation within it.  It's frequently
used to do interpolations of irregularly sampled data, but
that's not my interest.  

Suppose I have a Deluaney triangulation, T, of
the set of points which comprise all the intersections between
a set, L, of lines.  T is a set of triangular tiles.
What I need to show is that there is no triangle in T
which is crossed by any of the lines L.

Empirically I've found this to be true for the cases
that I use, but I'm not clear how I'd prove
it generally -- or if it is not true generally, whether
there are any restrictions I can place on L to ensure
that it is true.

If anyone has any comments or can point me to appropriate 
references I'd be very grateful.

Well, I managed to come up with the following counterexample:
draw 4 lines forming an elongated diamond, such that their
intersection points are ABCD.

                 A

            B         C

                 D                 

Then draw a new line EF:

                 A
                  E

            B         C

                F
                 D

The triangles BFC and BCE will belong to the
Delauney triangulation, yet the line EF will
intersect them.

Nice try, but then the central "hole" is lined with 4 sets of three coplanar
faces. As an alternative, glue an additional block onto each of the 4
faces of each of the four corner blocks.

The listed combinations are the only ones which can occur in _convex_

The Geometry Junkyard: Polyominoes
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Polyominoes and Other Animals

Connected subsets of the
square lattice tiling of the plane are called
polyominoes.  These are often classified by their number of squares,
so e.g. a tetromino has four squares and a pentomino has five;
this nomenclature is by analogy to the word "domino" (a shape formed by
two connected squares, but unrelated in etymology to the roots for "two"
or "square").

If a polyomino or a higher-dimensional collection of cubes forms a shape
topologically equivalent to a ball, it is called an animal.  A
famous open problem asks whether any animal in three dimensions can be
transformed into a single cube by adding and removing cubes, at each
step remaining an animal (it is known that removal alone does not always
work).  Other related figures include polyiamonds (collections of equilateral triangles), polyabolos (collections of half-squares),
and polyhexes (collections of regular hexagons).

Blocking

In the interest of stating simple problems for the net...

Does a perfect rational triangle exist? Question D21 in Richard K. Guy's Book
"Unsolved Problems in Number Theory" (Springer-Verlag) rudimentarily discusses
the problem. This triangle is defined as one with rational sides, rational
medians, rational altitudes, and hence rational area.

In my own research on a personal computer, the following 16 sets of almost
perfect rational triangles were found where the 3 sides and medians are
rational, but not the area.

   Rational Triangles with rational sides and medians

     Sides               Medians               Area

In addition, the following 2 sets of triangles were found that had 3 rational
sides, 2 rational medians and a rational area. These appear to be much rarer
than those above.

Rational Triangles with 3 rational sides, 2 rational medians, and rational area

    Sides               Medians                       Area

875 626 291     sqrt(557580.25) 572   216.5          55440 

I am satisfied that an infinite number of each type exist, although this is a
strong conjecture. Also it should be noted that taking the medians, and using
them as sides, leads to a conjugate triangle, so all these solutions listed
come in pairs. In the second case, this means a rational triangle with 2
rational sides and 3 rational medians.

Can anyone out there find more examples, especially of the second type listed,
and mail the results back to me at randall@ncr-sd.UUCP? These will be forwarded
to Prof. Richard K. Guy in Calgary, Alberta, of course, so he can append and
update his information on Problem D21 in his excellent book.

Thanks again, if your interest is stimulated by this article, and you decide
to work upon finding more rational triangles.

This will be treated in the next edition of Richard Guy's book, 
Unsolved Problems in Number Theory. A draft I have reads, modulo some 
light editing, as follows:

There are infinitely many solutions of the problem of integer distances 
from the corners of an equilateral triangle of side t. John Leech has 
sent us a neat and elementary proof of the fact that the points at 
rational distances from the vertices of any triangle with rational sides 
are dense in the plane of the triangle. This result was proved earlier 
by Almering. Arnfried Kemnitz notes that a = m^2 + n^2; 
b, c = m^2 +/- mn + n^2 with m = 2(u^2 -v^2), n = u^2 + 4uv + v^2 gives 
t = 8(u^2 - v^2)(u^2 + uv + v^2) and an infinity of solutions in which 
the points are neither on the sides nor the circumcircle of the triangle. 
A computer search showed that (57, 65, 73, 112) was the smallest such. 

Among the references Guy lists, the following may be relevant:

Subject:        perfect triangle

David:
Recently Ralph Buchholz and I have proved that an infinity of
Heron triangles with two rational medians do exist, using two
Somos(5) series that Michael Somos discovered. We have also found
two isolated Heron 2 med triangles that hint at more infinite
chains, but despite our best efforts, we've not discovered their
chains. Look for our paper in the American Mathematical Monthly.
Recently, looking at some Legendre elliptic curves that Ralph
and I discovered, and at some concordant forms of the 1/2 angle
tangents of Heron 2 median triangles and 3 median triangles, I
feel that the perfect triangle does NOT exist. The proof most
likely will follow a Pocklington type of contradiction argument.

Subject:        Two more interesting geometric problems

David:
Two more problems that I love, but did not see on your web page,
which, btw, is very nice, is the rational box, or properly called
integer cuboid problem, whereby we look for a rectangular
parallelopiped, such that its edges and diagonals and space diagonal
are all integer. With some examination, it can be seen that 7
terms occur, and solutions have been found in 3 types, wherein
the 7th parameter is irrational, the other 6 rational. Two types
are the body and face cuboids, e.g. 104,153,672(697) face cuboid
and 44,117,240(sqrt(73225)) body cuboid which are the smallest
occurrances with integer sides. Edge cuboids exist also. I've
found over 29,000 of the 3 types, they occur in a B:E:F 3:2:3 ratio.
No perfect cuobids were found with the smallest edge < 1,281,000,000
This is problem D18 of Dr. Richard K. Guy's "Unsolved Problems
in Number THeory"
THe other problem is the nesting of right triangles inside each
other, and how far chains of primitive right triangles can nest.
I have found up to 16 such chains of right triangles. An example
is (the pythagorean generators are listed) 
36836,25135
31919,24920
31345,13312
24585,17576
23069,10780
18129,15140
23335,288
19177,5360
14957,7820
12033,9860
11455,6936
12425,1048
12253,220
8685,7864
8759,4738
(by way of explanation, if the pythagorean generator is 2,1 then
 the right triangle sides are 2*2*1, 2*2+1*1, and 2*2-1*1 which is
 the very familiar 3,4,5 right triangle)
These chains are not easy to find. 
I hope you find these two problems interesting.

Apparently, it is not that famous, but it is special in the sense
that if you consider all special lines, like bisector etc.,
some of them have rational lengths. Check for yourself. For example, one
altitude is 12.

:
  It's a "Heronian" or rational triangle.  It's formed by taking a 9-12-15
right triangle (similar to the 3-4-5), and a 5-12-13 right triangle, and
joining them along the side of length 12 to form a triangle.  I guess it's
the simplest rational triangle formed from two dissimilar integer-sided
right triangles.
  There's a section in Maurice Kraitchik's "Mathematical Recreations"
about integer-sided right triangles which mentions Heronian triangles.

    1) Dissect a 3,4,5 triangle into 4 pieces and form a square.

You know, by the way, that this is also possible for the equilateral triangle?

    2) Dissect a square into 5 pieces and form 3 squares of different sizes.

Any ideas what ratios of the four squares are possible?  Obviously they
must satisfy a^2+b^2+c^2=d^2 where d is the side length of the large
square and a,b,c are the three smaller ones.

I can solve it for (a,b,c,d)=(2,3,6,7), (1,4,8,9), (2,6,9,11),
(3,4,12,13), and (8,9,12,17).  Let me know if you want pictures of
these.  All my solutions have axis-aligned cuts; I don't know how to do
it for irrational ratios of side lengths (for which some diagonal cuts
would be necessary).  I also don't know of a solution for (2,5,14,15)
or (2,10,11,15).  All other integer solutions have d>=19; I haven't
tried any of them.

Hi David and Joshua,

I saw your messages about dissection problems in the
Geometry Junkyard.  On Joshua's second question,
"Dissect a square into 5 pieces and form 3 squares of different sizes.",
part of chapter 8 in my new book "Dissections: Plane & Fancy" is about
dissecting 3 squares to 1 square in 5 pieces.

There are several infinite families with 5-piece solutions.
David has identified one of them, of the form (a,a+1,a^2+a,a^2+a+1).
The problem (2,5,14,15), for which David didn't know a solution,
is in one of the classes; its solution is in my book.
I don't recall offhand whether (2,10,11,15) is in one of
the classes; I would have to check on it.

Part of chapter 9 deals with dissecting 3 equilateral
triangles into one triangle in 5 pieces.

So, is it possible for a five-piece dissection of three different
squares to one larger square to be hinged?  One of my 2-6-9-11
dissections has a hinged pair of pieces for one square but the other
pair is not hinged.

I don't know of any five-piece dissection of three different
squares to one larger square that are hinged.  But I wasn't
looking for hinged dissections when I studied three squares
to one.

Your example 2-6-9-11 falls into a class that I call
the square-sum class: 
For x^2 +y^2 +z^2 = w^2,
  x is a square number,
  y is twice a square,
  and w = x + y.
(For your example, x=9, y=2, and w=11.)

Five-piece dissections for this class can be derived
from 6-piece dissections of general (i.e., real number)
relationships where 
  w = x + y, with z < 4 min {x,y}.
The conversion replaces a 3-piece P-slide
with a 2-piece step.

I was looking at 3-squares-to-1-square dissections again this afternoon,
cleared up one of the cases I didn't know how to handle before,
and found two general families of dissections that were new to me.
So, I was particularly interested to look at chapter eight of my new
copy of your book to see if these or similar dissections were there.
They weren't. Does this mean they're new?

The families are:

(A) x=1, y=2k, z=2k^2, w=2k^2=1 (formed by m=q=k, n=1, p=0)
    for which the first few examples are (1,2,2,3) (1,4,8,9) (1,6,18,19).
    I've drawn an example of the dissection for (1,8,32,33)
    in http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/1-8-32-33.ps.gz
    which I hope makes the general construction clear.

(B) x=(k+1)^2, y=2k^2, z=2k(k+1), w=2k^2+(k+1)^2 (formed by n-1=m=q=k, p=0)
    for which the first few examples are (2,1,2,3) (9,8,12,17) (8,9,12,17).
    I've drawn an example of the dissection for (25,32,40,57)
    in http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/25-32-40-57.ps.gz
    which I hope makes the general construction clear.

Both of these have w=x+y or w=x+z, like your two square-sum classes.
Maybe all square-sum classes have five piece dissections?  But the
dissection families we know for the different square-sum classes are all
pretty different from each other...

Your figure 8.19 is not (as you assert) an isolated occurrence.
It is related to a Pellian equation involving rational approximations to
sqrt(2).

If the two small squares in one solution are x and y
(so the two larger ones are floor and ceiling of x^2+y^2),
then the next solution has x'=x+2y-1, y'=2x+5y-3.

So starting from (1,2,2,3), you get (4,9,48,49) (your figure),
then (21,50,1470,1471), then (120,289,48960,48961), then
(697,1682,1657466,1657467), then (4060,9801,56271600,56271601)...

Nice!  I am unfamiliar with Pellian equations and will have
to look them up.  I played around with the solutions yesterday,
and noticed that the y's are either b^2 = 2 a^2 +1
or b^2 + 1 = 2 a^2.  Whence b/a is a rational approximation of
sqrt(2), which is I guess what you were referring to.

It's interesting that this seems to be a very sparse class
in comparison to the others.

Should be in any introductory number theory book.

    I played around with the solutions yesterday, and noticed that the
    y's are either b^2 = 2 a^2 +1 or b^2 + 1 = 2 a^2

Right, these (with 2 substituted for your favorite integer) are exactly
Pell's equations.  If you translate the statements that the two
staircases in the figure work into equations, you get something of the
form 2(y-x)^2 - (2x-1)^2 = 1.

    It's interesting that this seems to be a very sparse class
    in comparison to the others.

Yes, exponentially sparse.  Probably the members of the family can be
expressed in a closed form involving powers of (I think) 3+-2sqrt(2),
but I didn't work through the generating function stuff to check this.

Note that you can also get an interesting family of Pythagorean triples
from the same sequence of approximations to sqrt(2):
3^2+4^2=5^2, 20^2+21^2=29^2, 119^2+120^2=169^2...
In general these have the form x^2+(x+1)^2=z^2.  I've been trying
unsuccessfully to find a four-piece dissection for 20^2+21^2=29^2, in
the hope that it would extend to the whole family.

I'm also still stuck trying to find a dissection for 2^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 =
15^2, which I think is the only one with w<20 not covered by the families in
your book. This seems to be part of another family (x,y,y+1,w) related
to the same Pellian -- the next members of which seem to be (12,59,60,85)
and (12,348,349,493) -- y, z, and w are formed by halving the numbers
from the Pythagorean triples above but I don't yet understand the x's.

I tried a number of times without success.  It's interesting
that the only classes (so far) with 4-piece dissections
have one square much smaller than the other two, as one
looks at larger and larger instances.

For the exponentially sparse 3 squares to 1,
there is the corresponding relationship that fits into
chapter 4.  I didn't think about that when Robert sent me
his (then) isolated (4, 9, 48, 49).
The relationship is 
    x (w - x - y) = z (z - w + x)  for  x < y < z
and the dissection is the 7-piece P-slide analogue
of Robert's dissection.

Geometric Graph Coloring Problems

These problems have been extracted from "Graph Coloring Problems", T.
Jensen and B. Toft, Wiley 1995.  See that book (specifically chapter 9,
on geometric and combinatorial graphs) or its
online
archives for more information about them.

Hadwiger-Nelson Problem.  Let G be the infinite graph with
all points of the plane as vertices and having xy as an edge if and only
if the points x and y have distance 1.  What is the chromatic number of G?
It is known to be at least four and at most seven.



Ringel's Circle Problem.  Let C be a set of circles in the plane.
The circles may be of different sizes, and they may overlap; however, no
three circles in C can have a common tangent.  Let G be the graph with
vertices C and edges CiCj for circles
Ci and Cj having a common tangent.
Is there an upper bound on the chromatic number of G?
If so, it must be at least five.




Sachs' Unit-Sphere Problem.  Let M be a set of unit spheres
in Rn such that no two have interior points in common.
Let G be a graph with vertex set M and edges xy whenever spheres x and y
touch.  What is the maximum chromatic number for these graphs?

Sphere Colorings.  The chromatic number
X(Sr) of a sphere of
radius r in R3 is the minimum number of colors possible in a
coloring
of the points of the sphere in which any two points at unit (chordal)
distance apart are colored differently.
Is X(Sr)=4 for all r > 1/2?  More generally,
in dimension n,
is X(Sr)=n+1 for all n > 3 and all r > 1/2?

Graphs of Large Distances.  Let S be a finite set of
points in Rd, let dk be the kth largest distance formed
by pairs of points in S, and let G(s,k) be the graph with vertex set S
having an edge xy for all x and y in S such that the distance between x
and y is at least dk.  How large can X(G(S,k)) be as a
function of d and k?  What about when S is in convex position?

The answer is no.  A counterexample is the epsilon neighborhood of a
line segment of length L, as epsilon -> 0 and L is say 1/epsilon.  Call
this shape B.  In any packing of copies of B, consider the Voronoi
diagram.

It's not hard to see that for any copy of B, if the Voronoi cell is
compact, the number of Voronoi neighbors is large if epsilon is small:
That's because for any two lines that are distance at least 2 epsilon
apart, the orthogonal projection of one line to the other has length
O(-log(epsilon)); the same goes for their Voronoi interface, which is a
line epsilon distance from either.  The projection is even shorter if
one line segment "sees" another end-on instead of broadside.  Thus,
since each Voronoi neighbor blocks only a relatively short portion of
the perimeter, the number of Voronoi neighbors is large.

Consider any compact surface packed with copies of B.  Construct
the dual cell-division to the Voronoi diagram (the Delaunay triangulation).
The ratio of edges to vertices is large.  This implies the ratio of
Euler characteristic to #vertices = #copies of B is large.  But the
area of B is approximately 2, so the packing efficiency goes to 0.

Now, given three of the vertices, say A, B, C, construct the points D and E, 
so that ABCDE is a parallel pentagon.

I did this by first constructing a regular pentagon, and then applying some

It so happens I just prepared an answer to the posed question as
part of a textbook exercise.

Let a, b, and c be the three given points.  
Use _0 and _1 as x and y coordinates.
The coordinates of the center p=(p_0,p_1) of the circle through them is:

	p_0 =
	( b_1 a_0^2 
	- c_1 a_0^2
	- b_1^2 a_1
	+ c_1^2 a_1
	+ b_0^2 c_1
	+ a_1^2 b_1
	+ c_0^2 a_1
	- c_1^2 b_1
	- c_0^2 b_1 
	- b_0^2 a_1
	+ b_1^2 c_1
	- a_1^2 c_1 )
	 / D
	
	p_1 =
	( a_0^2 c_0
	+ a_1^2 c_0
	+ b_0^2 a_0
	- b_0^2 c_0
	+ b_1^2 a_0
	- b_1^2 c_0
	- a_0^2 b_0
	- a_1^2 b_0
	- c_0^2 a_0
	+ c_0^2 b_0
	- c_1^2 a_0
	+ c_1^2 b_0) 
	 / D

where

D = 2( a_1 c_0 + b_1 a_0 - b_1 c_0 -a_1 b_0 -c_1 a_0 + c_1 b_0 ).

The radius of the circle is then:

r^2 = (a_0 - p_0)^2 + (a_1 - p_1)^2

Degeneracies occur when D=0.

More efficiently (20 multiply/divide operations versus 57) use

p_0 = (((a_0 - c_0) * (a_0 + c_0) + (a_1 - c_1) * (a_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (b_1 - c_1) 
    -  ((b_0 - c_0) * (b_0 + c_0) + (b_1 - c_1) * (b_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (a_1 - c_1)) 
    / D

p_1 = (((b_0 - c_0) * (b_0 + c_0) + (b_1 - c_1) * (b_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (a_0 - c_0)
    -  ((a_0 - c_0) * (a_0 + c_0) + (a_1 - c_1) * (a_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (b_0 - c_0))
    / D

where D = (a_0 - c_0) * (b_1 - c_1) - (b_0 - c_0) * (a_1 - c_1)

The _squared_ circumradius is then:

r^2 = (c_0 - p_0)^2 + (c_1 - p_1)^2

This approach uses Cramer's Rule to find the intersection of two
perpendicular bisectors of triangle edges

Re: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/circumcircle.html

Circumscribing the triangle or tet or any simplex, given the vertex
coordinates, can easily be done algebraically with a little trick.  Expand

(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = R^2

to

x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 = R^2

Since this is non-linear in a, b, and R, it seems you can't easily use it to
find them.  But let

q = R^2 - a^2 - b^2                        [1]

and re-arrange to yield

(2x)a + (2y)b + q = x^2 + y^2              [2]

which is now linear in a, b, and q.  Apply at 3 points and solve by Cramer's
rule:

     |(x1^2 + y1^2) 2y1 1|
     |(x2^2 + y2^2) 2y2 1|   |(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y2 - y1)|
     |(x3^2 + y3^2) 2y3 1|   |(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y3 - y1)|
a = ---------------------- = ---------------------------------------
        | 2x1  2y1  1 |           2 * | (x2 - x1)  (y2 - y1) |
        | 2x2  2y2  1 |               | (x3 - x1)  (y3 - y1) |
        | 2x3  2y3  1 |

Similarly,

      |(x2 - x1) (x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2)|
      |(y2 - y1) (x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2)|
b = -----------------------------------------
           (same denominator)

This is equivalent to Watson's formula, which he derived geometrically.  (A
side note: Watson could have saved 3 more multiplications in his formula by
incorporating a factor of 2 into his denominator term D.)  It's then cheaper
to find R by the original equation than by applying Cramer's rule a 3rd time,
etc.

This can also be written down by comparing Eq. [2] with the 'three-point
form':

     | (x^2  + y^2)   x   y   1 |
     | (x1^2 + y1^2)  x1  y1  1 |  = 0
     | (x2^2 + y2^2)  x2  y2  1 |
     | (x3^2 + y3^2)  x3  y3  1 |

For the sphere about a tet (after factoring out the 2's),

     |(x1^2 + y1^2 + z1^2)  y1  z1  1 |
     |(x2^2 + y2^2 + z2^2)  y2  z2  1 | 
     |(x3^2 + y3^2 + z3^2)  y3  z3  1 |
     |(x4^2 + y4^2 + z4^2)  y4  z4  1 |
a = ------------------------------------
         2 *  | x1   y1   z1  1 |
              | x2   y2   z2  1 |
              | x3   y3   z3  1 |
              | x4   y4   z4  1 |

and so on.  (The determinants are easily reduced to 3X3 size.)

This is not original with me, and I'm uncertain as to the source.  I found
the result for triangles in a computer program that was written 15 years ago
(which I've been using ever since) but only recently did I figure out how the
formula is derived.

P.S.: Your web pages are a valuable resource. Thank you for maintaining them
and please keep up the good work!

Yes, this linearization trick is pretty standard in computational geometry.
The specific variation you use, mapping a vector v onto (v,|v|^2),
turns circles or more generally spheres in d dimensions into planes
or more generally hyperplanes in d+1 dimensions. Your equation

     | (x^2  + y^2)   x   y   1 |
     | (x1^2 + y1^2)  x1  y1  1 |  = 0
     | (x2^2 + y2^2)  x2  y2  1 |
     | (x3^2 + y3^2)  x3  y3  1 |

is the standard equation for a plane through three points (xi,yi,xi^2+yi^2).

One reference for general ideas like this (i.e. of turning nonlinear
equations into higher-dimensional linear ones by adding extra variables
that are polynomials in the original equations)
is "A general approach to d-dimensional geometric queries",
A. C. Yao and F. F. Yao, 17th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing (1985) 163-168.
But probably the same idea was known long before then in
less algorithmic contexts.

I've added your message to my page (I assume this is ok; let me know if not).

Let a, b, c, d, and m be vectors in R^3.  Let ax, ay, and az be the components
of a, and likewise for b, c, and d.  Let |a| denote the Euclidean norm of a,
and let a x b denote the cross product of a and b.  Then

    |                                                                       |
    | |d-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)] + |c-a|^2 [(d-a)x(b-a)] + |b-a|^2 [(c-a)x(d-a)] |
    |                                                                       |
r = -------------------------------------------------------------------------,
                              | bx-ax  by-ay  bz-az |
                            2 | cx-ax  cy-ay  cz-az |
                              | dx-ax  dy-ay  dz-az |

and

        |d-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)] + |c-a|^2 [(d-a)x(b-a)] + |b-a|^2 [(c-a)x(d-a)]
m = a + ---------------------------------------------------------------------.

                                | dx-ax  dy-ay  dz-az |

Some notes on stability:

- Note that the expression for r is purely a function of differences between
  coordinates.  The advantage is that the relative error incurred in the
  computation of r is also a function of the _differences_ between the
  vertices, and is not influenced by the _absolute_ coordinates of the
  vertices.  In most applications, vertices are usually nearer to each other
  than to the origin, so this property is advantageous.  If someone gives you
  a formula that doesn't have this property, be wary.

  Similarly, the formula for m incurs roundoff error proportional to the
  differences between vertices, but does not incur roundoff error proportional
  to the absolute coordinates of the vertices until the final addition.

- These expressions are unstable in only one case:  if the denominator is
  close to zero.  This instability, which arises if the tetrahedron is nearly
  degenerate, is unavoidable.  Depending on your application, you may want
  to use exact arithmetic to compute the value of the determinant.
  Fortunately, this determinant is the basis of the well-studied 3D orientation
  test, and several fast algorithms for providing accurate approximations to
  the determinant are available.  Some resources are available from the
  "Numerical and algebraic computation" page of Nina Amenta's Directory of
  Computational Geometry Software:

  http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/cglist/alg.html

  If you're using floating-point inputs (as opposed to integers), one
  package that can estimate this determinant somewhat accurately is my own:

  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html

- If you want to be even more aggressive about stability, you might reorder
  the vertices of the tetrahedron so that the vertex `a' (which is subtracted
  from the other vertices) is, roughly speaking, the vertex at the center of
  the minimum spanning tree of the tetrahedron's four vertices.  For more
  information about this idea, see Steven Fortune, "Numerical Stability of
  Algorithms for 2D Delaunay Triangulations," International Journal of
  Computational Geometry & Applications 5(1-2):193-213, March-June 1995.

For completeness, here are stable expressions for the circumradius and
circumcenter of a triangle, in R^2 and in R^3.  Incidentally, the expressions
given here for R^2 are better behaved in terms of relative error than the
suggestions currently given in the Geometry Junkyard
(http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html).

Triangle in R^2:

     |b-a| |c-a| |b-c|            < Note: You only want to compute one sqrt, so
r = ------------------,             use sqrt{ |b-a|^2 |c-a|^2 |b-c|^2 }
      | bx-ax  by-ay |
    2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |

          | by-ay  |b-a|^2 |
          | cy-ay  |c-a|^2 |
mx = ax - ------------------,
            | bx-ax  by-ay |
          2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |

          | bx-ax  |b-a|^2 |
          | cx-ax  |c-a|^2 |
my = ay + ------------------.
            | bx-ax  by-ay |
          2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |

Triangle in R^3:

    |                                                           |
    | |c-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)]x(b-a) + |b-a|^2 (c-a)x[(b-a)x(c-a)] |
    |                                                           |
r = -------------------------------------------------------------,
                         2 | (b-a)x(c-a) |^2

        |c-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)]x(b-a) + |b-a|^2 (c-a)x[(b-a)x(c-a)]
m = a + ---------------------------------------------------------.
                           2 | (b-a)x(c-a) |^2

Finally, here's some C code that computes the vector m-a (whose norm is r) in
each of these three cases.  Notice the #ifdef statements, which allow you to
choose whether or not to use my aforementioned package to approximate the
determinant.  (No attempt is made here to reorder the vertices to improve
stability.)

In a private response to Herr Kerscher's question, I recommended that he
look at this page, particularly my contribution to it. Let me say that
Prof. Shewchuk's criticism regarding relative error is not only correct,
but also of some practical significance. The good behavior which he
refers to is obtained for 2-D triangles using the particular form
(attributed to Jim Ward) given by the most recent
comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ at
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/graphics/algorithms-faq/faq.html
This form has the desired property of using only differences between
coordinates.
An added advantage when using integer arithmetic is that such forms
avoid overflows in many more practical cases (e.g., simplex far from
origin).

Thus, my formula given in the Geometry Junkyard:

     |(x1^2 + y1^2) 2y1 1|
     |(x2^2 + y2^2) 2y2 1|   |(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y2 - y1)|
     |(x3^2 + y3^2) 2y3 1|   |(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y3 - y1)|
a = ---------------------- = ---------------------------------------
        | 2x1  2y1  1 |           2 * | (x2 - x1)  (y2 - y1) |
        | 2x2  2y2  1 |               | (x3 - x1)  (y3 - y1) |
        | 2x3  2y3  1 |

needs to be taken another step to achieve the desired property.
The terms in the first column of the numerator should be re-written like
this:

(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) = (x2 - x1)(x2 + x1) + (y2 - y1)(y2 + y1)

(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) = (x3 - x1)(x3 + x1) + (y3 - y1)(y3 + y1)

The formulas for tets in 3-D in the Geometry Junkyard need similar
treatment.

It is a skill to visualize well in 3D. Similarly, it is a skill to 
visualize 4D objects. As I am trying to improve both, and feel I have had 
some success visualizing certain 3-manifolds immersed in C^2 (I'm working 
on seeing the CP^2 structure), I am a bit less skeptical. I recommend the 
following articles and threads from geometry.college though some take the 
other point of view:

http://www.forum.swarthmore.edu/news.archives/geometry.college/article120.html
http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/4d.visualization.html
http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/viewing.4d.objects.in.3d.html
http://www.forum.swarthmore.edu/news.archives/geometry.college/article211.html

Those are mainly about 4D. Coxeter mentioned that in the course of a long
walk, he visualized a chain of polytopes, each the vertex figure of the
next, starting with a triangular prism and going to the 9th dimension.
This chain can't be extended, and he claims to have seen that, too! (The
sequence is important in other contexts, and Coxeter was not the first to
discover it. Unfortunately, I can't remember its name.) 4D seems within
reason, but I would like to know how to develop direct geometric intuition
about, say, the E8 or Leech lattices.

No, you can get a square by cutting a tetrahedron in half such that two 
vertices are "above" the plane and two are below.

In slightly more generality, if there are n points above the plane and m 
below, then the intersection is the Cartesian product of an n-point 
simplex and an m-point simplex. For example, (n,m)=(2,3) yields a 
triangular prism. Note that there are nm vertices of this figure, yet in 
the most symmetric case there are only 2 distances between the vertices. 

If there are p points in the plane, n above, and m below, then the result 
is the p-times iterated cone over the product of n-point and m-point 
simplices. For example, when (p,n,m) = (1,2,2), the result is a 
square-based pyramid; when (p,n,m) = (2,2,2), the result is a hyper 
pyramid whose base is a square-based pyramid. This even makes sense when 
one or more of p, n, and m equal 0.

The proofs are straightforward, so I hope I did them correctly: First, 
note that the combinatorial type is determined by p, n, and m. Second, 
use the coordinatization of an k-point simplex as nonnegative real 
ordered k-tuples which sum to 1. For the p=0 case, it suffices to 
consider the plane defined by setting the sum of the first n coordinates 
to 1/2; this is also implies that the sum of the last m coordinates is 
1/2, hence the intersection is the Cartesian product of 1/2-size n-point 
and m-point simplices. The case of p>0 is similar.

This is a really neat problem. I'll have to think about the higher
co-dimension cases and cubes, cross-polytopes, and hemi-cubes instead of
simplices. I'll also post to the Geometry Forum's geometry.puzzles,
geometry.college, and/or goemetry.research
(http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/index.html), but I don't
see how to link those to posts to sci.math.

Subject:        Harary's animal-achievement game - some questions

Yet Another Posting arising from browsing old SciAm issues...

[MG1] Martin Gardner, "Mathematical Games"
      Scientific American 240:4 (April 1979) pp. 18-21

[MG2] Martin Gardner, "Mathematical Games"
      Scientific American 241:3 (September 1979) p. 26

[WW]  Elwyn Berlekamp, John Conway & Richard Guy, "Winning Ways"
      (Academic Press, 1982) [vol 2] pp. 684-685

[MG1] and [WW] describe a class of two-person games invented by 
Frank Harary. They are played on a square matrix and the players 
alternately mark a previously unmarked cell with a player-specific 
symbol [as in noughts-and-crosses = tick-tack-toe]. A player wins if
he forms a congruent copy [reflections are allowed] of a specified 
"animal" [a.k.a. "polyomino"] of cells all marked with his symbol.

By the usual strategy-stealing argument, with optimal play the game
must be either a first-player win or a draw, so it's only fair to
count a draw as a second-player win. In fact there's a variant in
which all the second player does is to try to stop the first player 
forming the animal: she doesn't win by forming one herself. An animal
which can be achieved by the first player on a sufficiently large 
board is a "winner", one that he cannot form is a "loser".

The main result mentioned in [MG1] and [WW] is that there are just
twelve animals that are winners:

  *    *-*   *-*-*   *-*   *-*-*-*   *-*-*    *-*-*   *-*
                       *                 *      *       *-*

  *-*-*-*    *-*-*-*   *-*-*      *-*-*-*
        *        *         *-*          *-*

Well, maybe "result" isn't quite the right word, as although the
Hales-Jewett pairings shown in [MG1] and [WW] certainly prove all
other animals losers [although note that both these specify the
same wrong pairing for demonstrating that

      *-*-*-*
      *     *

is a loser - e.g. see [MG2]], the status of the final hexomino
(named "Snaky" by Harary) is admitted to be uncertain, [MG1]
saying that it is "believed" that a first-player win in 13 moves 
on a 15x15 board is possible, and [WW] giving the same numbers
but succinctly adding the caveat "but Snaky is a bit shaky".

Q1. Surely someone has settled this one way or the other by now,
    if only by brute force computation? 

[MG1] and [WW] both give minimum numbers of moves (m) and minimum
board sizes (b for a bxb board) for the winners. These don't agree,
for at least two reasons: 

 1. There is a difference between 
    a) m_1, the minimum number of moves to win on an infinite board, 
       and b_1, the minimum size of board in which one can win in 
       m_1 moves; and
    b) b_2, the minimum size of board on which it is possible to win,
       and m_2, the minimum number of moves necessary to win on such
       a board.
    [MG1] is trying to give (b); [WW] (without making it very clear)
    seems to be attempting (a).
 2. Some entries are just wrong. E.g. [MG1] gives (b=4,m=5) for the
    Z-shaped tetromino, [WW] correctly gives (b=3,m=5) [correctly
    according to either (a) or (b), in this case]. To add to the
    confusion, in [MG2] Gardner writes "for the 4-cell animal Knobby
    [the T-shaped tetromino] the move number is 4, not 5" -- but
    [MG1] already correctly [I think] gave (b=5,m=4) for this animal!

Q2. Has anyone worked out the correct optimal (boardsize,moves) values
    for each winning animal?

There are all sorts of potential variations: triangular or hexagonal
grids, 3-dimensional grids, games in which the players try to make
different animals, games in which they try to avoid making specific
animals, etc., etc. In [MG1] Gardner writes "Harary is planning a book
on achievement and avoidance games in which all these generalisations
of ticktacktoe and many other closely related games will be explored".

Q3. Did this book ever appear? What other work has been done in this 
    area in the last 15 years?

With thanks in advance for any information on this subject.

I can't resist posting a related problem.  By a hexahedron we mean any
convex polyhedron in R^3 combinatorially equivalent to a cube; that
is, a polyhedron with six quadrilateral faces meeting three at each
corner.  Assume that three of the four body diagonals meet at a common
point.  Prove that all four of the body diagonals meet at a common
point.

This has applications to how many projective toric varieties can have
a (combinatorial equivalent of the) octahedron as their image under
the moment map.

Ukrainian Easter Egg


Let S be a set of points in d-dimensional space,
each with a weight that is not known precisely, only known
to fall within some range.  Also assume a range on the total weight of S.
In what region might we find the centroid of S? 
The answer turns out to be a convex polytope,
the projection of a drum-shaped section of a (d+1)-dimensional
zonotope.  The example below provides a lower bound of
Omega(nd) on the complexities of these centroid polytopes.




Zonotopes are defined using the Minkowski sum of sets A and B in
a d-dimensional vector space, which is the set {p + q | p in A and q in
B}.  A zonotope is a special kind of convex polytope formed by taking
the Minkowski sum of a collection of line segments.  Familiar examples
of zonotopes include the cube (generated by three unit length segments
at right angles to each other) the rhombic dodecahedron (generated by
four segments), and the truncated octahedron (generated by six
segments parallel to the edges of the octahedron).
Paul Heckbert has constructed a more complicated

zonohedron generated by 30 vectors in a circle.
The figure above is similar to Heckbert's, but is
generated by two sets of line segments,
with the endpoints of the two sets forming two different circles.
The segments on the larger circle determine the overall shape of the zonotope,
while the segments on the smaller circle lead to the existence
of the belt of narrow faces near the equator of the zonotope.
If one cuts this zonotope by a plane, one gets a polygonal slice
with Omega(n2) sides.


Edelsbrunner [Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry, Springer, 1987] writes 
``it is very instructive to visualize the inductive construction
of a zonotope''.
To add the ith segment z(i) to the Minkowski sum,
we sweep the current zonotope parallel
to z(i) and then take the swept volume as the new zonotope.
If we assume that the ith segment runs ``north-south",
this step enlarges the current zonotope
by stretching its ``equator'',
a belt of faces of dimensions up to d-2,
into a ``zone'' of faces of dimensions up to d-1. 
Faces of zonotopes are themselves lower-dimensional zonotopes. 


There is a nice connection between d-dimensional zonotopes and
(d-1)-dimensional arrangements.  We consider the space of unit normal
vectors of hyperplanes tangent to the zonotope.  The d-dimensional unit
vectors form a sphere, equivalent to oriented projective (d-1)-space.
Any given unit vector is normal to a unique hyperplane that touches the
zonotope at some kind of face.  One can swing a hyperplanes while
keeping it tangent to a k-dimensional face, passing through a collection
of angles with dimension (d-1-k); these angles form a cell in this
projective space and the faces of the zonotope thus correspond to a dual
cell decomposition of space.  If there were only a single vector, this
decomposition would be given by a single hyperplane (partitioning the
tangents into those that touch the origin, those that touch the endpoint
of the vector, and those parallel to the vector that touch both points).
But the decomposition corresponding to a Minkowski sum is formed by
overlaying the decompositions corresponding to the two summands, so the
cell decomposition of the tangent space to a zonotope is exactly a
hyperplane arrangement.  In particular, a zone of faces parallel to a
given vector corresponds exactly to a hyperplane.

Because of this correspondence, one can construct zonotopes
in time O(nd-1).  The figure above
was constructed by a
Mathematica package
for 3-dimensional zonotopes
(available in
HTML, 
Mathematica notebook format,
or as a postscript tech. report)
that I wrote using a slower but simpler algorithm.

I'm sorry not to suggest an answer, but the task reminds me of what is 
called the Barnach-Tarski Paradox. Using the process of decomposition 
into finite sets it is possible to divide the set of points on the 
surface of a sphere into partitions which can be rearranged into two 
spheres both of which have the same surface area as the original sphere.
Needless to say, the nature of the partitioning is such that you 
couldn't actually cut the sphere and physically rearranging it.

This is not a trick, but a proven result! The original paper includes 
a 16 page proof (in French), but I've lost the reference (Sorry). 
There is a more recent book devoted to the paradox and its 
implications but I don't have a reference to it either. Perhaps if one
found the original paper, one could partition it and rearrange it to 
form the book :^)

This may be nonsense, but ...
Take n+1 points P_i distance 1 apart in n dimensions,
and n+1 points Q_j distance 1 apart in "another" n dimensions.
Consider the (n+1)^2 points (P_i,Q_j) in 2n dimensions.
Aren't these either distance 1 or \sqrt{2} apart?

From:           David Eppstein <eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU>

About two years ago all three of you posted messages to sci.math about
the following:

: Problem 1: how many points can you place in n-dimensional real
: euclidian space s.t there are only 2 distinct interpoint distances,
: and neither of them is zero?

The best answer I saw at the time was to take the cartesian product of
floor(n/2)- and ceil(n/2)-dimensional regular simplices, giving (n/2 +
1)^2 points for n even and (n^2-1)/4 points for n odd.  However one can
do about a factor of two better by taking the edge midpoints of a single
simplex, giving (n+1 choose 2) points (this can also be viewed as a
certain slice through a hypercube).  E.g. in 4d the product construction
gives 9 points while the edge midpoint construction gives 10.

In 3d both constructions give the same number of points (6),
and there are two different 6-point pentagonal pyramids that also work.

In 5d you can get 16 points by taking every other point on a hypercube,
slightly beating the 15 points produced by the edge midpoint construction.

Did any of you make any more progress on the problem?  How about upper
bounds?  Something like 4^n follows from Ramsey theory, and n + 2^(n+1)
is not hard to prove (every point is determined to within two positions
by its vector of distances from some n-tuple), but still seems very
weak.  Is O(n^2) the right answer?

Re the message I sent you yesterday about the 2-distance set problem --
I found it today while looking up something else in Croft, Falconer, and
Guy, Unsolved Problems in Geometry, Springer, 1991 (it's problem F3,
p. 152).  They mention the d(d+1)/2-point (edge-midpoint-of-simplex
solution as well as some slightly better solutions for d=6 and d=22.
(They don't mention my 16-point solution for d=5.)  They also cite an
upper bound of (d+1)(d+2)/2.  Apparently the exact optimum solution is
not known for d>3, but these upper and lower bounds are within a factor
of 1+o(1) of each other.

A triangulation of a an n-vertex convex polygon is a partition
by n-3 chords into n-2 triangles.  No 2 of the chords intersect
in the interior of the polygon.

I want to know how many different areas are possible.  Formally,
I want a function t(n) as large as possible (linear would be ideal)
satisfying:

for all n-vertex convex polygons there exists a triangulation
containing at least t(n) triangles of different areas.

I have not seen how to create an example in which 3 triangles
must have the same area.  I would be interested in such an
example, if it exists.

The polygons I am interested in are special.  They lie in planes
in R^3, and all of the vertices are lattice points, within the
m x m x m cube.  The normal directions to the planes can be written
with integer coordinates at most m.  An answer in terms of m would 
be helpful, although less satisfying.

The Margulis Napkin Problem asks one to prove that it is impossible to
fold a unit square to form a flat shape who perimeter is greater than 4.

Rumor has it that all Russian graduate students of mathematics know how
to solve this Problem, but that as soon as they come to the U.S. (as so
many of them seem to do!), they forget how it's done.

Can anyone offer a rigorous proof?

Date:           Tue, 20 Feb 1996 21:30:53 +0100
Organization:   University of Oslo

Someone posted the following question some time ago:

If you have a quadratic piece of paper and fold it a number of 
times, prove that the circumference cannot exceed 4 (the original 
circumference).

I couldn't find the original posting, hence, I quote the Problem
as I remember it.

=================================================================

SOLUTION:

If you have a piece of paper with any shape, I wish to prove that
when folding it, the circumference will be reduced. Say that you
fold it along a line AB where A and B are the endpoints, and where
the line AB is included in the paper before folding. (If there is
a hole in the paper or the paper is non-convex, AB may pass over a
region which is not included in AB. We will deal with this later.)

Now, AB is included in the paper. When folding along AB, the
circumference is increase by AB due to the folding. The two
components of the paper each have circumference that go from A to B:
ie. you may follow the circumference of any component from A to B.
When folding this, you get a new circumference: the outermost of
these. We may however follow the part of the original circumference
that falls inside the folded paper. This, too, gives a curve from A
to B and must therefore have length at least AB. Hence, though we
gain AB, we loose more than AB.

If the line AB is not fully contained in the paper, you may let
the intersections between AB and the circumference of the original
paper by P_1, ..., P_2n (n components of AB). The 'inner
cricumferences' as were constructed above will arise here to, but
will connect pairs of points P_i (not neccesarily neighboring points).
The conclusion follows as above.

I think the point of the MNP was that what is folded repeatedly is the
original square, not the image of the square at each stage. Certainly
the first fold decreases the circumference, but subsequent folds may
"unfold" bits that have been folded in, possibly in some strange way.
The "foldings" at each stage are locally isometric maps of the
square into R^2, and the "circumference" at each stage is the circ. of
the image. But it is the square that is folded at each stage (like an
origami construction), not its image.

Is the Problem known to be true then? (as J. Propp's post suggests)

     The above is not a full solution.  If your paper likes to stick to
itself so much that after any fold you may again consider yourself to have
only a single thickness of paper, the above argument works as advertised.
However, even the most trivial of origami folds (including a mountain fold
somewhere, for example) requires that the paper be partially unfolded at 
some point.  Not all flat folded shapes are achievable from simple folds
of the type outlined above.  Now, if someone wants to show that the 
*shadow* of any flat folded figure is achievable with the shadow of a 
figure including only simple folds, the above is the required final step.
However, I don't believe that part about shadow achievability.  :-)
I think a proof would have to consider an arbitrarily folded flat figure
and the prover should be careful with any inductions used.

Yes, this is not too hard.

This reasoning doesn't work with the intended terms of the question.
If by "fold" you mean a composition of maps (x,y) -> (|x|,y),
then yes.  But in the more usual sense of folding, the perimeter
can go back up when you make a second fold:

            _______
           /.      |
          / .      |
      ___/...      |
     |  /  .       |
     | /  .        |
     |/  .         |
     /  .          |
    /. .           |
   / ..            |
  /...             |
  |                |
  |________________|

So a reasonable rigorous interpretation of the question is:
If f is a continuous piecewise isometry from the square [0,1]^2
to the plane R^2, is the perimeter of f([0,1]^2) not more than 4,
with equality only for isometries?

Also, I'd like to know about a generalization:  Does there
exist a shape of napkin the can be folded so that its perimeter
goes up?

Several people have submitted incorrect solutions that neglect the fact
that parts of the paper that disappear from view can reappear when a 
subsequent folding takes place.  

For instance, take a piece of paper and draw two horizontal lines, 4/9 
and 5/9 of the way down the page.  Make a mountain fold along one line.  
Now make a valley fold along the other line.

The upshot is that the perimeter need not be a decreasing function of time,
so simple proofs-by-induction like the one recently posted here will not 
suffice.

It has been pointed out to me by several that my proof only covers a
group of special cases: foldings that may be described by a line segment
and where the paper is folded along that segment. There are several
foldings that may not be described this way, in particular cases where
only the upmost sheet of paper is folded.

I cannot see any way of fixing the proof.

So to conclude, I am (we are?) back in the wilderness again.  :-)

This statement cannot be right because, if you folded the result of your
folding back into the original state, you would get the piece of paper
you started with but this time with smaller circumference (perimeter?).
Contradiction. 

However, I would like to see a proper solution myself. 

Sorry for the inconvenience

Quite so, but it is not even that simple--your mention of a
"subsequent folding" suggests an intention to apply one folding at a
time to the napkin.  But I doubt that every locally isometric map is
achievable by a discrete sequence of simple foldings, even when we
allow both folding parts together and unfolding previously folded
sections.

As a candidate for this complication, I offer a shape that I hope will
_not_ become known as "Hoey's hankie".  Form a radiating fan-fold with
apex A whose circumference BCDEFG has repeated z-shaped overlaps.

                    F                      time.

For another complication, consider that this example can be
constructed by manipulations in three-space, using inelastic piecewise
flat paper with a finite number of fold lines.  But I don't see any
reason why the existence of such a construction is guaranteed in
general.  Could there be a shape that you could not form without
temporarily bending the paper into a curve?  Could there be one that
requires stretching or cutting and pasting?

I don't know if these complications lead us toward counterexamples to
the original conjecture.  They do make the attempts at proofs by
"inductive construction" more dubious, though.

Dear David,

Just browsed through your geometry junkyard, whose Margulis napkin
problem page leaves the impression that the proposition is true, if
not quite proved.  As your mathematical origami page points out,
it's false, and you might want to give a hint of that in the other
page (or throw it out entirely?). 

Furthermore, it seems that arbitrarily large perimeter is possible.
Maybe you already know this, but, imagining a silk handkerchief 
rather than paper, rule it into an nxn grid, and gather the perimeter
of each little square into a point.  If you can do this, you have
n^2 pillae each of height O(1/n), and sharing a common point as a
base; splaying them out to all sides gives perimeter O(n).  It seems
I was not the first to realize this, and I am assured by Robert Lang 
that the folding is indeed feasible, and that this is proved by 
various papers here and there, albeit not all in one place.

which is exactly the right strategy. Not only can you make the perimeter of 
the star-shaped base larger than the original square; you can make it 
arbitrarily large. If you fold an order-N Sea Urchin (from Origami Sea 
Life), it has N^2 points, each of length (1/(2(N-1))). If you make the 
points arbitrarily thin (using lots and lots of sink folds!), when you 
flatten it, you'll get a total perimeter of N^2/(N-1), which is unbounded 
as N is large.

You don't have to go to this extreme, however. If you thin the points of a 
Bird Base, you can splay the points out into a shape with a perimeter 
greater than a square. The trick in either case is to create one or more 
middle points.

To recap: Jeannine posted a query about whether it's possible
to fold a shape
with a perimeter larger than the original square; Mark Casida
suggested
squashing a Sea Urchin; and I observed that:

..you fold an order-N Sea Urchin (from Origami Sea Life).
It has N^2 points, each of length (1/(2(N-1))). ****If you make
the points
arbitrarily thin**** [emphasis added] (using lots and lots of
sink folds!),
when you flatten it, you'll get a total perimeter of N^2/(N-1),
which is
unbounded as N is large.

and

You don't have to go to this extreme, however. ****If you thin the 
points**** [emphasis added] of a Bird Base, you can splay the points out 
into a shape with a perimeter greater than [that of] a square.

Jeannine takes me to task:

>>>>
  Not so fast, Robert!  When you flatten the sea Urchin, portions of each 
  point overlap neighboring points, reducing the total perimeter. And I can't 
  get the bird base trick to work either, at least not without little tears 
  appearing in the edges of the paper as the points spread apart.  Can you 
  check your theory, and give more specific instructions?
<<<<

I added the asterisks to my original comments to emphasize an important 
point; if you're really going to try this, you definitely have to thin the 
points, or as Jeannine points out, you'll lose perimeter due to the regions 
where the points overlap. The thinner you make the flaps, the less you 
lose. And in fact, as you'll see below, you have to thin them a _lot_ just 
to reach break-even.

To quantify this and to provide a specific example in the case of the Bird 
Base, take a unit square (I get these from OUSA Supplies) and fold a Bird 
Base in the all-flaps-down position (kite-shaped). Denote the height of the 
top triangle by z (z is (Sqrt(2)-1)/2, but that's not important to the 
argument). Now narrow all four long flaps (and the top flap) by sinking the 
_sides_ in and out on parallel creases, dividing each side into nths. After 
sinking, spread-sink one flap on each side, so you end up with a real 
skinny thing with one flap pointing upward and two flaps on the left and 
right pointing down. Reverse-fold two of the downward-pointing flaps out to 
each side, and spread the two remaining downward-pointing flaps slightly so 
there is a gap between them.

Now, your shape lies completely flat and has four long flaps and one 
shorter one. Because of overlapping layers, each of the long flaps, which 
ideally would have a perimeter of slightly more than (1), has lost (2z/n) 
in length. The top flap has a perimeter slightly over (2z). So the total 
perimeter of the shape is 4(1-2z/n)+2z = 4 + 2z(1-4/n) (actually a teensy 
bit more because of some angled edges, which I'm neglecting for now).

So if you compare this to the perimeter of the original square, you see 
that for n=4, you've just about broken even; but if you divide into 5ths or 
more, you'll come out ahead. And if you make the points "arbitrarily thin", 
which only occurs in pure mathematics and Origami Insects And Their Kin, 
the perimeter of the Bird Base shape approaches the value 4+2z, or about 
4.414. Similar arguments (and many more sinks) apply to the Sea Urchin.

I assume you mean the midpoints of the arcs rather than the chords, as it
is demonstrably false otherwise.  I don't know is this is an elegant proof,
but it is what came to mind immediately.  Rather than writing down a formal
proof which looks all yucky, I will describe it, as the idea is really very
simple.

Draw the circle, the 4 points, the 4 midpoints and the two chords.  Mark
clearly which pairs of arcs are equal to each other (there are 4 different
lengths).  Now draw the chord between two non-adjacent midpoints, forming a
triangle.  We want to show that the angle at the intersection is a right
angle.  This is true iff the other two angles of the triangle add up to 90
degrees.  But these angles are subtended by arcs the sum of whose lengths
is half the circumference, hence their sum is 90 degrees.  QED.

Geoff.

Sierpinski Tetrahedra and Other Fractal Sponges

This seems to be everyone's favorite three-dimensional fractal, so much
so that I've had to add a separate page for it and several other closely
related fractals. The Sierpinski Tetrahedron has Hausdorff dimension
two, so maybe it's not really a fractal in the "fractional dimension"
sense of the word.  It can be formed in many ways: (1) start with a
single tetrahedron and remove octahedra from it, (2) recursively combine
quadruples of tetrahedra into larger tetrahedra, (3) take "Pascal's
Pyramid" of trinomial coefficients modulo two, (4) form the graph of the
binary exclusive-or function on the unit square.  The last construction shows
that if you look down on it from the right direction, it just looks like
a square, but from other viewpoints it has plenty of holes, so it can
form a sort of "Venetian blind" that casts shadows only in certain
directions.

    The book "The Foundations of Geometry and the Non-Euclidean Plane"
    by George E. Martin lists the following 26 equivalents to the
    Parallel Postulate within absolute geometry:

    Proposition A.  Euclid's Parallel Postulate: If A and D are points
	on the same side of segment(BC) such that measure(angle(ABC)) +
	measure(angle(BCD)) < pi, then ray(BA) intersects ray(CD).

    Proposition B.  Euclid's Proposition I.29: If A and D are points on
	the same side of line(BC) and line(BA) || line(CD), then
	measure(angle(ABC)) + measure(angle(BCD)) = pi.

    Proposition C.  Euclid's Proposition I.30: l || m and m || n
	implies l || n for lines l, m, n.  (Lines parallel to a given
	line are parallel.)

    Proposition D.  Contrapositive to Euclid's Proposition I.30: A
	third line intersecting one of two parallel lines intersects
	the other.

    Proposition E.  Euclid's Proposition I.31, Playfair's Parallel
	Postulate:  If a point P is off line l, then there exists a
	unique line through P parallel to l.

    Proposition F.  A line perpendicular to one of two parallel lines
	is perpendicular to the other.

    Proposition G.  l || m, r is perpendicular to l, and s is
	perpendicular to m implies r || s for lines l, m, r, s.

    Proposition H.  The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a
	triangle are concurrent.

    Proposition I.  There exists a circle passing through any three
	noncollinear points.

    Proposition J.  There exists a point equidistant from any three
	noncollinear points.

    Proposition K.  A line intersecting and perpendicular to one ray of
	an acute angle intersects the other ray.

    Proposition L.  Through any point in the interior of an angle there
	exists a line intersecting both rays of the angle not at the
	vertex.

    Proposition M.  Euclid's Proposition I.32:  The sum of the measures
	of the angles of any triangle is pi.  The measure of an exterior
	angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the
	remote interior angles.

    Proposition N.  Theorem of Thales:  If point C is off segment(AB),
	but on the circle with diameter segment(AB), then angle(ABC) is
	right.

    Proposition O.  If angle(ABC) is right, then C is on the circle with
	diameter segment(AB)>

    Proposition P.  The perpendicular bisectors of the legs of a right
	triangle intersect.

    Proposition Q.  l is perpendicular to r, r is perpendicular to s, and
	s is perpendicular to m implies l intersects m for all l, m, r, s.

    Proposition R.  There exists an acute angle such that every line
	intersecting and perpendicular to one ray of the angle intersects
	the other ray.

    Proposition S.  There exists an acute angle such that every point
	in the interior of the angle is on a line intersecting both
	rays of the angle.

    Proposition T.  There exists one triangle such that the sum of the
	measures of its angles is pi.

    Proposition U.  There exists one triangle with defect 0.  [The defect
	of a triangle is pi less the sum of the measures of the angles of
	the triangle.  This is a restatement of Proposition T].

    Propositoin V.  Saccheri's Hypothesis of the Right Angle:  There
	exists a rectangle.  [The Hypothesis of the Acute (Obtuse) Angle:
	There exists a quarilateral with two adjacent right angles and
	two adjacent acute (obtuse) angles.  These apply to the hyperbolic
	and elliptic planes, respectively.]

    Proposition W.  There exist two lines l and m such that l is
	equidistant from m [all points of l are at a constant positive
	distance from m].

    Proposition X.  If three angles of a quadrilateral are right, then
	so is the fourth.

    Proposition Y.  There is some line l and some point P off l such that
	a unique line parallel to l passes through P.

    Proposition Z.  There exist a pair of similar noncongruent triangles.

Subject:        Re:  Aperiodic Space-filling tile?

    My tile is a very simple one.  It is aperiodic (only)
in the sense that no tiling with it admits a translational
symmetry.  This seems to be the standard sense now, and it
is a good one because in particular it implies that the
tiles can't be grouped into equal clumps that are all
embedded similarly in the tiling.

   Take a triangular prism:

            /|\
           / | \
          /__|  \
          \  \  |
           \  \ |
            \__\|

Make it "generic" - in other words, avoid certain equalities
between the sides and angles.  In particular, don't make the
side faces be rectangles.  [The apparent right angles in the
triangles of my sketch are there only because of the limitations
of this keyboard.]

    Now take another such prism, again as generic as you can 
get it, subject to the condition that one of its parallelogram
faces has the same shape as one of the ones on the first prism,
oriented in such a way that you can stick the two prisms together
to make a "biprism" in which no two triangles share an edge.
Then this biprism is my tile.

    Which biprisms are sufficiently "generic", you may ask.  I
don't know a very easy way to find out, though almost all of
them are, of course.  Here is what's needed:

    1) It must be impossible to fit the pieces together in any
way except those in which the constituent prisms line up
in parallel, triangle-to-triangle:

             /|\
            / | \
           /__|  \
           \  \  |
            \  \ | \
             \__\|  \
              \  \  |
               \  \ |    
                \__\|

    This sticks the biprisms together in two-dimensional "waffles"
which are then stacked to form the whole tiling.  

    2)  The angle of rotation between two adjacent "waffles" must
not be  60  or  90 degrees.

    I just worked out one case.  I took a rhombus made of two
triangles root2,root2,1  for the common face,  and took points
vertically above and below the midpoints of the edges to be
the other four vertices:

                 /\
                /  \
               A    B
              /      \
             /        \
             \        /
              \      /
               D    C
                \  /
                 \/

   A and C are above the plane,  B  and  D below it, so that the
"roof edges" of the prisms are  AC  and  BD.

    I made the angles of the triangular faces at these vertices
be right angles, but that gives a very flat biprism.  I suggest
to make them something like  30  degrees for a better shape.

[This will still be generic enough.]    

  I imagine you will be a bit disappointed, because the tiling
is fairly "regular".  But in fact the tiles are necessarily
embedded in infinitely many distinct ways, however you do it.

Keywords:       Mutations, Knots, Vassiliev-invariants

In article <2c08v0$3s0@news.rhrz.uni-bonn.de> kasten@rhein.iam.uni-bonn.de (  Oliver Dasbach   ) writes:
>1.) How can I decide whether two knots K and L are mutants of one another?

Well, the conclusive method would be to find all possible ways to repeatedly
mutate K, which is not easy, but I think it is possible by Haken's
algorithms for incompressible surfaces.  By Thurston geometry, a knot
has only finitely many mutant equivalents.   In the main case, when
K is hyperbolic, mutation preserves hyperbolic volume, and there are
only finitely many hyperbolic manifolds with a given volume.

If you consider Haken-type algorithms too laborious, you can in
practice use various invariants to try to conclude that two knots
aren't mutants.  As already mentioned, there is hyperbolic volume.  But
also there is the Dehn invariant, as Danny Ruberman explained to me.
Recall Hilbert's problem of determining when two polyhedra are
equivalent by polyhedral dissection.  Dehn found an invariant beyond
volume which distinguishes, for example, cubes from regular tetrahdra.
As it happens, the Dehn invariant also works in hyperbolic geometry,
and moreover if two polyhedral are fundamental domains for the same
hyperbolic group, they are dissection equivalent.  So hyperbolic
groups have a Dehn invariant too.  Finally, mutation can also
be understood as a polyhedral dissection in the hyperbolic case,
so mutation classes have a Dehn invariant also.

Ruberman also told me that the Dehn invariant is a projection of
the Chern-Simons invariant of a hyperbolic manifold (this is not
the same as the Chern-Simons path integral of Witten).  I do not know
whether Chern-Simons detects mutation.

Besides hyperbolic geometry, you can also consider quantum invariants.
Following Reshetikhin and Turaev and a little bit of Witten, a compact
Lie group G and an irreducible G-module V determine a polynomial knot
invariant.  It is well-known that when G = SL(n), O(n), or SP(2n), the
invariants for all V's come from cablings and twisted cablings of
HOMFLY or Kauffman.  (I am principally excluding representations of
Spin(n) and exceptional Lie groups.)  It was noticed early on that many
of these invariants are mutation invariant.  Here a broad condition on
the pair (G,V) that suffices for mutation invariance of the
corresponding knot polynomial:  V tensor V should be multiplicity-free,
i.e., it should be a direct sum of distinct irreducible summands.  This
condition is almost certainly also necessary, although I do not have a
complete argument in my head for the exceptional groups and spinorial
representations (except I think that I have a complete argument for
G_2).

>2.) In which case is a knot K the only knot within its mutancy class?

First, to mutate, you need to find a four-point tangle in K which is
not rational.  In some cases, such as all torus knots I think, no such
tangle exists.  Also, in the hyperbolic case, if there is only one knot
of the same volume as K, then mutation on K must yield K.

>3.) Is a Vassiliev-invariant v(i) known such that there exist (non-equivalent)
>    knots K and L, mutants of each other, and v(i)(K)<>v(i)(L)?

Sure.  The derivatives at q=1 of quantum invariants are of Vassiliev type.
Consider a quantum invariant from a pair (G,V) where V tensor V is
not multiplicity free; for example you can take G = sl(n) for n>3
and V to be adjoint.  Then the quantum invariant will detect mutation.

More explicitly, for a knot K, take the bidirectional 2-cabling, i.e.,
replace K by two parallel copies of K, and orient one in direction and
the other in the other direction.  Then HOMFLY of this 2-cabling should
detect mutation in K most of the time.

THEY SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
I DID IT.
WOW!

Mathematicians go PARROTING AND PARROTTING that you
can't solve the THREE CLASSICAL GEEK PROBLEMS with
compass and straightedge.Well, LOOK AT THIS!

1. Doubling the angle

Let the angle be represented by two straight lines
through O. Draw any circle K with midpoint O which meets
the lines in A and B. Draw a circle with midpoint A
through B which meets K in C. OBC is the double of OAB.

2. Trisecting the circle

People were so STUPID! They tried and tried to trisect
with PARALLEL lines into segments, which INDEED is
impossible. But I used SECTORS!!
Let the circle K have midpoint O. Pick a point on the
periphery as midpoint and draw a circle through O 
which meets K in A and B. The sector AOB has 1/3 area
of circle K.

3. Squaring the cube

Here, the DIMENSIONAL problem wasn't recognized. As
squaring the cube (volume) with side length x requires
a new side length x**2, x can't be a length with a unit,
because then x**2 would be an AREA!
So at least one unit length u:=1 must be given.
Draw two perpendicular lines. At the intersection,
mark x to the left and right and u to the top.
Construct the circle through that three points
in the usual way. It cuts off x**2/u at the bottom.
As u was DEFINED 1, this is the sought side lenght.

Now give me the NOBEL PRIZE!

The proof is omitted but should be obvious from the surrounding context.

Can you please try to clarify my perplexity over this question?

Obviously, most sets of n points in the plane will have no repeated
distances.  None.  So:  Whence the isosceles triangles?

(I am sure this question must have a very obvious answer, but I don't see it.)

Thanks,

Dan Asimov

Obviously, the problem asks about worst case bounds that are true for
all arrangements of points, rather than just a measure-1 subset of the
arrangements.

For instance, if you happen to choose points that form a sqrt(n)*sqrt(n)
integer grid, there will be many isosceles triangles.  (More than n^2 of
them, but fewer than n^(7/3).)

Ok, here is a the geometrical argument I promised on a previous post.
I'll show that any smooth, simple, closed curve in 3-space must have
total curvature at least 4*pi.  I'll try to keep the argument as
intuitive and geometrical as possible, although that's easier said than
done.

First, I'll show that the total curvature of _any_ closed curve (not
necessarily knotted) is at least 2*pi.  The lower bound for knotted curves
uses the same idea.

Let c be a smooth, simple, closed curve in R^3.  Think of c as a smooth
map from (an open set containing) the closed interval [0,r] into R^3,
parameterized by arc length (that is, |c'(t)|=1 for all t in [0,r]).
Thus r is the length of the curve, and

     c(0) = c(r),
     c'(0) = c'(r),
     c''(0) = c''(r),
     etc.

Let k(t) be the curvature of c at "time" t (0 < t < r).
If c is planar, then its total curvature must be at least 2*pi (equality
holding when c is convex) in order for its tangent vector to wind around
once.  Thus we can assume c cannot lie in any single plane.

For all t in [0,r], translate the unit tangent vector c'(t) back to the
origin.  As we go around the curve, this vector sweeps out its own curve
u on the unit sphere (i.e., u maps [0,r] into S^2 with u(t) = c'(t)).

Now note that the total curvature of c equals the total _length_ of u.
This is because for all t in [0,r]

     k(t) = |c''(t)| = |u'(t)|

so
     /r          /r
    |           |
    | k(t)dt  = | |u'(t)|dt  =  total length of u.
    |           |
   / 0         / 0

Thus it suffices to show that u has length at least 2*pi.  Now for t in
[0,r], define H_t to be the hemisphere of S^2 centered at u(t).  That
is,

    H_t  =  { v in R^3 :  |v| = 1  and  u(t).v > 0 }.

I like to think of H_t as a cap on the sphere, moving around with the
vector u(t), and at each time t, H_t covers exactly half of the sphere.

The proof boils down to two main points: First, as H_t moves around, it must
eventually cover the entire sphere.  That is, every point on the sphere
must be covered by H_t for some t in [0,r].  Second, H_t can only cover
new points so fast (new area covered is proportional to |u'(t)|).  Thus,
for H_t to cover the entire sphere, u must have some minimum length, which
turns out to be 2*pi.

To be more precise, say that a point v in S^2 is _painted_ at time t_0 if
0 < t_0 < r, and v passes from being uncovered by H_t to being covered by
H_t at time t = t_0.  That is, immediately before t_0, v is not in H_t,
and at t_0, v is in H_t.

1.   I claim that for every v in S^2 there is a t_0 in (0,r] such that
     v is painted at t_0.

[Proof]: Suppose not.  Then there is a point v_0 on the unit sphere that
either always remains covered or always remains uncovered by H_t.  Assume
without loss of generality that v_0 is always covered (if v_0 is always
uncovered, look at its antipodal point).  But this means that v_0.u(t)
> 0 for all t in [0,r].  Therefore, c'(t) always has a nonnegative
component in the v_0 direction, so if c(t) is to loop back on itself
(c(0) = c(r)), c'(t) must always be perpendicular to v_0 (i.e.,
c'(t).v_0 vanishes everywhere).  Then c is planar, contrary to our
assumption.  Q.E.D.

2.   H_t paints new area on S^2 at a rate equal to 2*|u'(t)|.  That is,
     if A(t) is the area of that portion of the sphere painted before time
     t, then A(t) can increase at a rate of at most 2*|u'(t)|.

[Handwave proof]:  Consider a small interval [t,t+dt].  Within the
interval, u moves almost in a straight line (remember, u is smooth).
The points that are painted in this interval approximately constitute
a section of the sphere swept out by the advancing boundary of H_t.
This section is bounded by two great semicircles with the same endpoint,
with maximum width |u'(t)|*dt.  The area of this section is approximately
2*|u'(t)|*dt.  (For example, think of u taking a great circle route around
the sphere; its total length is 2*pi, and the total area swept out is 4*pi.)
Taking the limit as dt approaches 0 gives the result.  Q.E.D.

Now the main result for (unknotted) closed curves:
At time t=0, no points are painted (A(0) = 0).  At time t=r, all the
points on the sphere are painted (A(r) = 4*pi) by claim 1.  Thus u must
have total length at least 2*pi by claim 2.  Q.E.D.

Now suppose c is knotted.  I claim that each point on the sphere is
painted _twice_ (two coats :-).

Suppose there is a point v_0 on S^2 which is only painted once.  By
reparameterizing the curve c (actually a cyclic shift), we can assume
v_0 is painted at some point t_1, and v_0 is uncovered for all t in
(0,t_1), and is covered for all t in [t_1,r].  In this case, c has the
following behaviour with respect to the direction v_0: at t=0, c starts
moving with a component in the negative v_0 direction and keeps moving
in this direction until t_1, where it turns around and moves in the
positive (actually nonnegative) v_0 direction until t=r.  (Its motion in
the other two orthogonal directions may be arbitrary.)

The curve c therefore cannot be knotted: it resembles a circular
rubber band that is anchored at opposite ends and twisted.  It may twist
and turn arbitrarily in the middle, between the two ends, but it can
always be unwound into a circle again.

So if c is knotted, the sphere must be entirely painted twice, making
the total area to be covered 8*pi.  By claim (2) above, the spherical
curve u must have total length at least 4*pi, thus the total curvature
of c is at least 4*pi.  Q.E.D.

Dissection Tiling
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Dissection Tiling



It has long been known that for any two polygons of equal area (or
groups of polygons adding to the same area) there is a collection of
smaller polygonal pieces that can be arranged to form either of the two
polygons; this partition into smaller pieces is known as a
dissection.  For instance, a square may be partitioned into four
polygonal pieces, which can be rearranged to form an equilateral
triangle of the same area.  This idea was used by Hilbert to develop an
axiomatic theory of plane area.  Dissection has some potential
application to random generation of points; it is easy to generate
uniformly distributed points in a square, so by dissecting the square to
another shape one can generate points in that shape.  Dissection is also
closely related to the Banach-Tarski paradox (which concerns itself with
similar set-theoretic partitions).  But problems of dissection also have
more recreational aspects, concerned with minimizing the number of
pieces in dissections of specific shapes.

I am interested here in a different but closely related problem:
partitioning a polygon or group of polygons into a dissection such that
the pieces can be rearranged to tile the plane.  Each piece must be used
with a density proportional to its area (otherwise one could just take a
square out of the middle of one polygon and not use the other pieces).
Any polygon can be dissected and rearranged to form a unit-width
rectangle, so any group of polygons has a dissection tiling.
Tilings have been used directly for constructing dissections (by
overlaying two tilings with the same fundamental domain), but they also
are useful for understanding n-to-one dissections in the limit as n
grows large -- the number of pieces can be approximated by kn+O(sqrt n)
where k is the average pieces/polygon in a dissection tiling.  This sort
of averaging allows different copies of a polygon to be cut differently;
for instance we can cut two pentagons into a dissection tiling averaging
1.5 pieces/polygon whereas the best one could do with a single polygon
would be 2.  I depict below the best dissection tilings I know of (in
terms of this average) for various regular polygons, star polygons, and
groups of polygons.  Since this emphasis is somewhat different from
previous work on the subject, many of the dissections here are new.

Triangles, Squares, and Hexagons

These all tile the plane without dissection.


Pentagons

If one is given a single pentagon as input, the best one could hope to do
in a dissection tiling would be to cut it in two pieces.  Many different
dissection tilings use this number of pieces.  However it is possible
to achieve a better average pieces/pentagon by allowing
some pentagons to be cut differently than others:




Two pentagons may be partitioned into three pieces that tile,
giving an average of 1.5 pieces/polygon
[original, Nov 1995].


Note that the average pieces/polygon of any pentagon dissection
tiling must be bounded away from one.  To see this,
let d be the maximum density of a packing of pentagons on the plane;
then d= 1 everywhere,
and f(x,y) >= 2 on a (1-d) fraction of A,
the average pieces/polygon is at least 2-d > 1.
A similar argument applies to any input that does not itself
tile the plane.


Octagons

The octagon appears to be very stubborn.
It is easy to find a two-piece dissection
(just remove a rhomb from one corner, not shown.)
It is also possible to tile the plane with equal numbers
of undissected octagons and squares.
However I have been unable to find any
dissection tiling of multiple octagons
using fewer than two pieces/polygon.


Heptagons and Nonagons




This dissection tiling of the nonagon [original, Dec 1995], involving
three different strips with straight boundaries, must be aperiodic: the
strips have incommensurate periods, and one must alternate the strips in
an aperiodic way to achieve the correct density of each type of piece.
One can use this idea to get tilings with pieces/polygon arbitrarily
close to 2.5.  The same ratios are achievable by periodic tilings, by
chopping the narrower strips into long pieces of commensurate lengths,
and performing slide dissection on the remaining rectangular "scraps" to
make them also commensurate.

One might think that an aperiodic tiling such as this one would be
of no use in constructing dissections, but in fact a nine-piece
dissection of the nonagon to a triangle (credited by
Lindgren to Irving Freese) is related to a similar aperiodic
dissection tiling in which four trapezoids are cut from the nonagon to
leave an equilateral triangle.  Robert Reid and Gavin Theobald further
improved this dissection to eight pieces using similar methods.




The same method can also be used to find dissection
tilings of the heptagon with pieces/polygon arbitrarily close to 2
[original, Dec 1995].


Six-point Stars

There are multiple ways of partitioning a six-point star into two pieces
that tile, for instance one can simply connect two opposite reflex
vertices.  However as usual the average pieces/polygon can be reduced by
dissecting several stars at once:




Three six-point stars can be dissected into five pieces
for an average of 1.666 pieces/polygon
[original, Nov 1995].  The same pieces can be arranged in other ways
(and other dissections are possible)
but this version has a pleasing amount of symmetry.


Eight-point Stars

There are two different regular eight-point stars:
8/2, in which the edges at the outer vertices point towards
vertices two points away (also formed as unions of two squares)
and 8/3, in which the edges at the outer vertices point towards
vertices three points away.  More generally any star a/b
is formed with a outer corners, each connected to the next by
segments pointing in the direction of the corner b points away.
(This notation is not necessary for 5- and 6-point stars
as only one value of b is possible for them.)




This four-piece dissection tiling of the 8/2 star [original, Dec 1995]
is easily generalized
to tilings with average pieces/polygon arbitrarily close to 3.
With a little rearrangement it can be used to find a 7-piece dissection
of 8/2 to a square, different from the one by Frederickson
in his book with Lindgren.




One 8/3 star can be dissected into two pieces that together tile
[credited by Grünbaum and Shephard to D. P. Chavey but not depicted there].


Nine-point Stars




One 9/3 star can be dissected into five pieces that tile
[original, Feb 1987, based on a six-piece dissection in
Grünbaum and Shephard].  Note the interesting three-way symmetry in
the tiling.


Pentagons and Decagons

Several different dissection tilings are possible for inputs
consisting of a mixture of pentagons and decagons, depending on the ratio
between the two shapes.




Four pentagons and one decagon can be dissected into six pieces
for an average of 1.2 pieces/polygon
[original, Nov 1995].




Fifty pentagons and eleven decagons can be dissected into seventy pieces
for an average of 1.148 pieces/polygon
[original, Nov 1995].




Five pentagons and one decagon can be dissected into eight pieces for an
average of 1.333 pieces/polygon [original, Nov 1995].  However
it seems likely that an even better average can be obtained by
somehow mixing the 50:11 dissection above with the 2-pentagon
dissection.  This should give an average of 155/132, which is just barely
worse than 7/6, so perhaps there is a seven-piece dissection
of the same six polygons.


Pentagons and Stars




Four pentagons and one five-point star can be dissected into six pieces
for an average of 1.2 pieces/polygon [original, Nov 1995].
The star can also be divided into two congruent pieces, or 
a pentagon can be cut and the star left intact.




Even better, ten pentagons and three stars can be dissected
into 15 pieces, for an average of 1.154 pieces/polygon [original, Dec 1995].


Octagons and Stars




There are many ways of combining octagons with 8/2 stars
to form reasonably good tilings.  The best one I found
(in terms of the average pieces/polygon 28/23 ~ 1.2174)
is formed by dissecting 17 octagons
and 6 stars into 28 pieces.  One of the octagons is partitioned into
squares and rhombs, and the other polygons are all left intact
[original, Nov 1995].




But this is not best!  14 octagons and 5 stars can be dissected into
only 23 pieces, giving a ratio of 1.2105.
[Robert Reid, July 1998].


Three Dimensional Dissection Tiling

In three dimensions, it is not true that any polyhedron has a dissection
into any other polyhedron of the same volume;
for instance the regular tetrahedron can not be dissected to
an equal-volume cube.
As a consequence, it can also not be dissected
to pieces that form a periodic tiling, because one could
then dissect a parallelohedral fundamental domain into cubes.
However it is not clear to me whether a dissection tiling
of the tetrahedron is totally ruled out by this argument, because an
aperiodic tiling (with the correct limiting density for each piece)
might still be possible.


It is known that any two zonohedra of equal volumes can be
dissected into each other.  Since some zonohedra tile (e.g. the
parallelohedra and the rhombic dodecahedron), all zonohedra have
dissection tilings.  However to my knowledge none have been explicitly
constructed.

Subject:        Re: Traveling Salesman Problem and Delaunay Graphs

Recently, Michael I. Shamos posted the following message:

      In a recent post, Walter Schmitting asserts that my 1978 Ph.D.
  thesis on Computational Geometry contains the conjecture that a
  Euclidean traveling salesman tour is a subgraph of the Voronoi dual. 
  This conjecture appears nowhere in the thesis, nor in any other of my
  published writings.
      I can confirm that I did indeed conjecture, for a period of about
  three weeks, that the stated result was true.  A counterexample was
  shown to me by Richard Karp during a visit of his to CMU in 1977, long
  before the result of Kantabutra and Dillencourt.  The conjecture
  appeared for a brief time in my unpublished notes entitled "Problems in
  Computational Geometry."  As I was not a referee of the
  Kantabutra-Dillencourt paper, I was unable to correct any misimpression
  it may have given.

I have exchanged several email messages with Dr. Shamos since he posted
this message.  I have also checked my earlier papers and Kantabutra's
paper.  I think at this point we can all agree that Dr. Shamos is right,
he never published a conjecture of this result, and neither Kantabutra
nor I ever claimed he did.  (There never was a joint Kantabutra-Dillencourt 
paper.)

This question of whether the Voronoi dual of a set of points necessarily
contained the Euclidean traveling salesman cycle was listed as an open 
problem in Dr. Shamos' PhD thesis (page 206, #6).  Dr. Shamos
told me that Prof. Karp showed him the counterexample after
his thesis had been submitted to University Microfilms, which
is where I got my copy.  

I was curious about the 1977 counterexample.  Dr. Shamos did not recall
the details, and Prof. Karp did not remember either discussing the 
problem or solving it.  Dr. Shamos said that he discussed the question
with Prof. Karp, who showed him how to construct a counterexample
and (most likely) promptly forgot about it.  I can easily believe
that this could have happened.

At one point in my email exchange with Dr. Shamos, I erroneously
interpreted one of his statements to imply that Prof. Karp had shown him
a 4-point counterexample.  Dr. Shamos later clarified this in
a subsequent message, but in the meantime I thought about the
problem and realized there is a 5-point counterexample.  This
is better than the 7-point counterexample in my 1985 paper 
[IPL 24(5), March 1987, 339-342].  This may or may not have
been the same example Prof. Karp discovered in 1977,
but in any case I thought it might be useful to describe it here.  

So now, finally, we get to the real point of this post, which is to describe
a 5-point example of a Delaunay triangulation that does not
contain the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Cycle (ETSC) as a subgraph.
This is the smallest such example.

The counterexample can be constructed as follows.  Take four cocircular
points A,B,C,D, in that order about a circle.  Choose a fifth point
E, outside the circle, chosen so that the convex hull of the five points
is the triangle ADE and so that C is very close to the edge DE.
If E is far enough outside the circle, and if the other four points
are chosen appropriately, one can force the ETSC to be the cycle
ABDCEA.  If B is perturbed by a tiny amount and moved just outside 
the circumcircle of ACD, then edge BD will not be in the 
Delaunay triangulation.

Rather than work out appropriate point locations analytically, 
I ran an experiment.  I generated four random points on a unit 
circle (choosing theta uniformly), and then generated a fifth point
randomly outside the unit circle and inside a circle of radius 8
(choosing theta uniformly, and choosing the radius uniformly in the 
range [1,8]).  Out of  100,000 iterations, 2709 (2.7%) of the
configurations generated were such that the ETSC contained one of the
chords of the four cocircular points (BD in the terminology of the preceding 
paragraph, after relabeling).  In each such case, if one of the
endpoints of the chord is moved slightly so it is just outside the circle,  
the  Delaunay triangulation will not contain the chord.  

There does not exist a four-point counterexample, if we disallow
the trivial case of a totally collinear point set.  Given any planar
set of four points, either the points are in convex position
(and the ETSC is the convex hull, which is a subgraph of the Delaunay
triangulation) or the Delaunay triangulation is the complete graph.

As I mentioned above, the example in my 1985 paper contained 
seven points, so it was not minimal.  That example also was the 
minimum-weight triangulation of its vertex set.  I don't know whether 
the construction sketched above can be used to construct a 5-point 
Delaunay triangulation that is also a minimum-weight triangulation and 
does not contain the ETSC.

I'll post a picture of a specific 5-point example on my web
site in the next week or so.

I'm not sure I understand your construction, but the following is a
small 5-point example:

                       ,C (5,2)
               (4,1) ,'/

 (0,0) (1,0)

The minimum Euclidean circuit is ABCDE, but edge AB does not appear in
the Delaunay triangulation (EC does).

The following set of nine circles requires five colors, if each pair 
of tangent circles must have distinct colors.  It is an
open 
problem, posed by Ringel, whether five or any finite number of colors 
is always enough for any circle arrangement (having no triple tangencies).

Ok, I admit it, these pages are merely an excuse for
me to try out Cinderella,
a nice multiplatform Java application by Kortenkamp and Richter-Gebert for 
setting up this sort of animation.  The black spots are anchor points, 
that you can drag around to produce different sets of circles with the 
same tangency pattern.

But anyway, there is some interesting math involved in constructing the

"Triangulations and Arrangements"
Godfried Toussaint
McGill University

All Institute Lecture
July 12, 1993

Scribes: Laura Anderson, Peter Yamamoto
Assistant Editor: Pedro Ramos

Professor Toussaint's lecture discussed algorithms for triangulating
simple polygons in the plane.  A polytope in higher dimensions may not
have any triangulation, but for a two-dimensional polytope a
triangulation always exists.  Several algorithms for computing a
triangulation were discussed including a short history of published but
incorrect algorithms.  The first talk was limited to triangulations;
arrangements were discussed in another lecture.

------------------------------------------------------------

First, some definitions:

A _diagonal_ of a polygon is a line segment which connects two vertices
of the polygon and which lies entirely inside the polygon.

A _triangulation_ of a polygon is a decomposition of the polygon into
non-overlapping triangles by diagonals.

Note that there are (n-3) non-intersecting diagonals which divide the
polygon into (n-2) non-overlapping triangles.

A fundamental lemma states that any polygon with n > 3 vertices can
be partitioned into two sub-polygons by inserting some diagonal of P.

First, note that this lemma does not generalize to higher dimensions.
A simple example, due to Sch\"onhardt in 1928, is constructed by
twisting a prism.  Construct a triangular prism in three dimensions by
using an equilateral (say of unit length) triangle base in the xy plane
and a copy of the base elevated above it (say translated by unit
length).  Finish the prism by attaching the two triangles with vertical
edges.  Now rotate one of the triangular faces 30 degrees about the
vertical axes, twisting the edges connecting the two triangles.  The
resulting polytope, with eight triangular faces, cannot be
triangulated. In fact, one cannot add even one diagonal without
breaking up a triangular face.

Second, despite the simplicity of the lemma, many published proofs of
it, or triangulation algorithms based on the lemma, are incorrect.
Professor Toussaint outlined three such errors.  For a more detailed
discussion the reader is referred to [Ho].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithms That Don't Work (But Made It Into Print):

First, Professor Toussaint noted that geometric algorithms, step by
step constructions using primitive operations, dates back to Euclid.
He also noted that despite this careful description of a construction
some algorithms do not always work.

There are a family of triangulation algorithms (or constructive proofs
of the lemma) which follow the same general approach:  at each step,
either cut off one empty triangle or add one diagonal. The algorithm is
then repeated on the resulting sub-polygon(s).

We first label the vertices of the polygon x(1), x(2),...,x(n) so that
for every i, the vertices x_i and x_{i+1} have an edge between them.

        Find vertex x_i with leftmost x-coordinate
        Look at the triangle [x_{i-1},x_i,x_{i+1}] formed by joining the
        two adjacent vertices.

        Step 1. If there are no other vertices inside that triangle
                then the triangle [x_{i-1},x_i,x_{i+1}] is empty so delete
                the triangle and repeat Step 1 on the resulting subpolygon.
        Step 2. Otherwise there is at least one vertex in the triangle. 
                Hence there is some vertex x(k) which can be joined
                to x_i with a diagonal thus splitting the polygon
                into 2 subpolygons.  Repeat Step 1 on the two subpolygons.

        There have been several published methods for handling Case 2.
        Most are based on an intuition which goes wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Do you have any ideas for determining how to join x_i to another
vertex to form a diagonal?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intuition 1: Find an empty sub-triangle of [x_{i-1},x_i,x_{i+1}] by
rotating a ray anchored at x_i from x_{i-1} to x_{i+1}.  Since there is
at least one vertex in the triangle, the ray will hit some vertex in
this rotation.  Suppose x(k) is the first such vertex.  Then the
triangle [x_{i-1},x_i,x(k)] doesn't contain any other vertices inside of it
(otherwise such a vertex would have been hit by the ray).  So connect
x_i to x(k).

Intuition 2: If there is a vertex in the triangle then there must be a
vertex closer to x_i than any other vertex (other than x_{i-1} and
x_{i+1}). So find the closest vertex x(k) in the triangle and join x_i
to x(k).

Intuition 3: Find the leftmost vertex x(k) inside the triangle
and join x_i to x(k).

Hints are at the end, but try to draw counterexamples to each of
the intuitions by yourself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A 20th-Century proof that Triangulations Always Exist

We define a vertex x_i of a polygon P to be _principal_ if
the triangle with vertices {x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1}} is empty.
If such a vertex is a concave point of P we call it a _mouth_
else it is convex and we call it an _ear_.

THE TWO-EARS THEOREM (Meister, 1975): Every simple polygon with
at least four sides contains at least two non-overlapping ears.

Meister provided a constructive proof which also provides a correct
but slow algorithm for triangulating the polygon.  Well, that's o.k. for
mathematicians but computer scientists were still unhappy...

Another proof is based on properties of the _dual graph of a
triangulation_.  Consider a point inside each triangle.  Attach one
point to another if their triangles share a side.  Note that a triangle
can share one, two, or three sides.  Furthermore note that the dual
graph must be a tree since if not, it has a cycle, and this would
represent a hole in the polygon which is not allowed (triangulation of
polygons with holes is another matter).

Now note that a leaf in the dual tree corresponds to a triangle with
only one adjacent triangle: an ear.  Since a tree with more than one
node always has at least two leaves, the triangulation must also have
at least two ears.

The theorem suggests a method for triangulating: ``find an ear and cut
it off''. This gives a correct but long algorithm for triangulating:
searching for ears to cut off can be very time-consuming. In the worst
case, triangulating a polygon this way can take O(n^3) time.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Some Algorithms That Do Work (And Are Faster Than Cutting Off Ears)

In a simple polygon, we can always find either an ear or a diagonal
in O(n) time.

Procedure DIAGONAL

Input: A simple polygon P oriented in a counterclockwise direction.
Output: Polygon P with a diagonal inserted in P.

Step 1. Find a convex vertex x_i of P.
Step 2. Construct a ray at x_i, ray(x_i), that bisects the interior of
        angle(x_{i-1}x_ix_{i+1}).
Step 3. Find the first intersection point, called y, of ray(x_i) with the
        boundary of P, bd(P).  y is on some edge [x_j,x_{j+1}] of P.
Step 4. Construct the triangle [x_i,y,x_{j+1}].
Step 5. For all j+1 < k < i, if x_k lies in triangle [x_i,y,x_{j+1}]
        then label x_k as x*_k.  If there are no labeled vertices
        then exit with [x_i,x_j+1] as the diagonal.
Step 6. For all labeled vertices, compute angle(y,x_i,x*_k) and select
        that vertex, call it z, which minimizes the angle.
        If z <> (is not equal to) x_{i-1}, then exit with [x_i,z] as the
        diagonal.
Step 7. Construct the triangle [x_j,y,x_i].
Step 8. For all j > k > i, if x_k lies in triangle [x_j,y,x_i] then
        label x_k as x*_k.  If there are no labeled vertices, exit with
        [x_i,x_j] as the diagonal.
Step 9. For all labeled vertices compute angle(y,x_i,x*_k) and select
        that vertex, call it w, that minimizes this angle.  If w <>
        x_{i+1} then exit with [x_i,w] as the diagonal.
Step 10. Exit with [x_{i-1},x_{i+1}] as the diagonal.

This procedure can then be used to triangulate in O(n^2) time.

To get an algorithm that works in better than O(n^2) time, let's first
consider the special case of a convex polygon. An O(n) algorithm for
triangulating it would be to start at some edge {x_i, x_{i+1}}, then
add either the triangle {x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1}} or the triangle {x_i,
x_{i+1}, x(i+2)} to our triangulation. Then we repeat this with the
edge we just added, and continue until the whole polygon is
triangulated.  Note that at every step we made a choice of which
triangle to add.

Consider the triangulation of the convex polygon that results from
joining every second vertex (remember the vertices of P are given as an
ordered sequence) to a fixed vertex and then joining every second
vertex with an edge.  In this case the dual tree has O(n) internal
nodes and O(n) leaves.

Now consider the triangulation of the same convex polygon obtained by
drawing all diagonals from one fixed vertex to all the vertices (this
is possible because of the convexity) resulting in a triangulation that
looks like a fan.  In this case, note that the dual tree is very
simple:  it is simply a chain since each triangle, except for the first
and last, has two adjacent triangles.  A triangulated polygon whose
dual tree is a chain is called a sleeve.  A convex polygon always has a
triangulation which is a sleeve.

The above triangulation process generalizes to simple polygons by
trying to triangulate subpolygons which are sleeves; these sleeves are
then joined together by triangles which are adjacent to three
triangles.  A diagonal, d, is inserted and the triangulation process
(join an adjacent vertex) starts at d assuming the part of the polygon
it is triangulating is indeed a sleeve.  Eventually the algorithm may
discover that it made a mistake (we are not in a sleeve) so it
backtracks until the triangulated portion is really a sleeve.  Now we
know that this sleeve must be connected to the rest of the
triangulation by adding two diagonals instead of just one. So we add
two diagonals and continue the sleeve searching from those two
diagonals.

This process will triangulate any simple polygon in O(n(1+t_0)) time,
where t_0 is the number of triangles in our output that have no edges
on the boundary of the polygon.  Note that these _free triangles_
correspond to degree 3 vertices in the dual graph (they have 3 edges).
In the worst case, there may be O(n) free triangles hence the algorithm
has worst case time complexity of O(n^2).

Since an O(n) time algorithm for triangulating _any_ simple polygon has
been found (a milestone in geometric computation), one may ask 'Why is
such an algorithm, with time complexity dependent on the output
triangulation, of any interest?'

The main reason is that the algorithm is more straightforward than
other algorithms (in particular the O(n) result is quite complicated
and hard to implement), and for certain classes of polygons it will
always run in O(n) time.  Professor Toussaint next outlined a brief
history of triangulation algorithms culminating in the recent O(n)
algorithm by Chazelle.  But he didn't end on that note, rather, he
described two more results on polygon triangulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Complexity History of Triangulating a Simple Polygon

        1) 1911 Lennes (American Math Journal but very computational essay)
                O(n^2) via recursive diagonal insertion.
                Question: Why was Lennes considering the triangulation problem 
                          in 1911?
        2) 1975 Meister
                O(n^3) via "ear-cutting"
        3) 1978 Garey, Johnson, Preparata, Tarjan
                O(n log n) via decomposition into monotone pieces.
        4) 1982 Chazelle
                O(n log n ) via divide-and-conquer technique.
        5) 1983 Herbert and Mehlhorn
                O(n + r log r ) where r is the number of reflex vertices.
        6) 1983 Chazelle
                O(n log s) where s is the sinuosity of P.
        7) 1987 Tarjan and Van Wyk
                O(n log log n) via "involved" data structures.
        8) 1988 Toussaint
                O( n (1 + t_0)) via sleeve searching where t_0 is the number
                of "free triangles" in the output triangulation.
        9) 1990 ElGindy, Everett, Toussaint
                Finding an ear in O(n) time via "prune and search" technique
                implies algorithm 2) can be done in O(n^2) time.
        10) 1990 Chazelle
                O(n) via very "involved" techniques.  
                Essentially unimplementable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is triangulation of a simple polygon history?

No, not really. Certainly the most important complexity question has been
answered by Chazelle, but fast practical algorithms are still desired
by industry  where practical may depend on the specific application.
Professor Toussaint went on to outline some of the other aspects
of the triangulation polygon in particular classes of polygons which
can be triangulated in linear time.  Only a brief review of topics
are listed as this "summary" is running a bit long.

A Palm-Shaped Polygon with respect to a point O is a polygon such that
the shortest geodesic path from O to any point is either right turning
or left turning.  This implies that the polygon may be
split into left palm subdivisions and right palm subdivisions.

Now Professor Toussaint went into an aside regarding the computation
of the convex hull of a polygon using the Graham scan (an algorithm for
finding the convex hull of a set of points).

ASIDE: Convex Hull via Graham Scan [Graham]
        3-coin description

        Find smallest x-coordinate vertex. Place coin on it and next two
        vertices. (or was it a convex turn?)

        If three coins form a right turn
                Then back coin goes to the front
                Else (if left turn)
                     middle coin goes back (if it can: can't go back 
                     behind starting vertex) and delete middle vertex.

        OBSERVATION: The Graham scan triangulates CH(P) \ P.

        Problem: Graham scan works well for star-shaped polygons but can
                 have problem with simple polygon: 

=> Bad polygon for Graham Scan (see if you can find a polygon
on which the Graham scan fails).

END of ASIDE:

        A right palm with respect to a point x.

Exercise: Show that you can always triangulate with the 3-coins
algorithm. (I guess he was running out of time).

Question: How hard is it to determine palm-shaped-ness?
Answer: You can find the "kernel" of a palm polygon in linear time.

So we can triangulate palm-shaped polygons in linear time.
In fact, the palm shaped polygons themselves contain several
other classes of polygons.  But that's not all...

Palm Decomposition of a Monotone Polygon

Given a direction in which P is monotone P can be decomposed in linear
time into the union of left and right palm polygons.  Hence, monotone
polygons may also be triangulated in linear time using the simple
3-coins algorithm as a procedure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Computing Bushy and Thin Triangulations

        Shermer 1988

        Thin  triangulation minimizes the number of degree 3 vertices in dual.
        Bushy triangulation maximizes the number of degree 3 vertices in dual.

        Algorithms:

        Bushy: O( T(n) ) and O(n) space where T(n) is the time for
               triangulating.
        Thin: O(n^3).

Problem: Can you do better for finding a thin triangulation?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Triangulating a Set of Points

        Does it always exist?

        Idea:   First, draw a simple polygon through the points.
                Second, triangulate inside and outside separately.

        Question: Can you always draw a simple polygon through a set of 
                  points?
        Answer: Yes. Choose 2 points such that no 3rd is collinear.
                Sort the other points with respect to perpendicular
                projection onto line through the two points.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Triangulating a set of Line Segments

        What is it?!

        A triangulation of the end points of the segments such that the
        segments are edges in the triangulation.

        Idea:   First, draw a simple polygon through the line segments...

        But that is not always possible.
        [Counter example: Existence of "Cutting line segment" means can't do
        it. "Cutting line segment": diagonal of the CH of the line segments].

Problem: So how to compute the triangulation?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point Professor Toussaint was out of time.  The last few
topics covered shows that there are still interesting triangulation
problems to be considered.

Two references are provided which contain more extensive
bibliographies related to the material presented.

Hints for intuitions gone wrong.  The hint for all three
counterexamples is that while x(k) may be a vertex which forms a
triangle with no other vertices inside of it, it doesn't mean that
there are no _edges_ cutting through the triangle!  In other words,
x(k) is separated from x(i) by some edge.  Given that hint, the trick
simply lies in constructing the polygon with an edge between x(i) and
x(k) such that the vertices of that edge (or edges connecting it to the
rest of the polygon) do not violate the "empty" conditions in the
intuition.

Topologists have written a number of papers concerned with this notion,
namely, describing a metric in which closeness implies not only
closeness with respect to the Hausdorff metric, but also resemblance
of figures with respect to some topological or geometric property.
Unfortunately, from the standpoint of computer science, most are
unsatisfactory for the following reasons:

	a)  Most of the interesting results obtained by topologists
        for these metrics are along the lines of:  Suppose two
        figures A and B are sufficiently close in such a metric.
        Then they have in common the following properties ....
        where the properties in question are often not of interest
        to computational geometers.

	b)  Most of the metrics described by the topology papers
	written for this purpose (at least, those papers I've
	read) are difficult or impractical to compute.

I have a paper, soon to appear in Pattern Recognition Letters,
in which I describe several metrics in which closeness of two
polygons A and B implies that A and B are close with respect
to the Hausdorff metric and that they have similar deviations
from convexity.  The results aren't real deep, nor are they
always satisfying from the standpoint of the goal of describing
a metric that is efficiently computable and in which closeness
would imply "similar geometry" -- but the paper is a start
in the direction of developing efficiently-computable metrics
that are stronger than the Hausdorff metric with respect to
measuring how well one figure approximates another geometrically,
as well as positionally.  The paper of Stern, cited below, is
another such attempt.

Below are some references on metrics (Hausdorff and beyond).
Some are topology references that may be useful to computational
geometers only from the standpoint of originating the suggestion
of adding another comparison of two figures to their Hausdorff
distance in order to obtain a stronger metric.  Others are
computational geometry references.

You're thinking of "mathematical morphology," the image processing
area that uses dilation.  The Hausdorff metric has been called the
basis of mathematical morphology, for whatever that's worth.

As the original post hinted, the Hausdorff metric is sensitive to
outlying points in a shape.  The so-called template metric, the other
one mentioned in the original post ( d(x,y) = area(x-y) + area(y-x),
where x and y are shapes ), ignores outliers, and the construction
of the Minkowski sum of a shape and a small ball (i.e. dilation) 
is not continuous in this metric.

The issue of what is a "shape" is, of course, important, but we in the
image processing world try to ignore such details when possible.  I
realize that's not appropriate here.  In general, the natural domain
of the Hausdorff metric is the set of compact shapes, and the natural
domain of the template metric is the space of measurable subsets.  As
noted, we can ignore sets of measure zero for the template metric, but
not for the Hausdorff metric.

But there are many other ways to define metrics between shapes. One I
use in my work is the transport, or Monge-Kantorovich metric:

For S_1,S_2 subsets of the real plane, d(S_1,S_2) = 
    inf { int_{S_1} int_{S_2}  abs(x_1 - x_2)  dp(x_1,x_2) },
where the inf is taken over all probability measures p on S_1 x S_2
with fixed marginals:
    int_{S_1} int_{U_2} dp(x_1,x_2) = area(U_2)/area(S_2),
    int_{U_1} int_{S_2} dp(x_1,x_2) = area(U_1)/area(S_1).
Think of this as the amount of work required to rearrange the pieces
of shape S_1 into the shape of S_2.  The transport metric is a good
combination of the template and Hausdorff metrics in practice, since
it gives equal weight to all points of a shape.  Its natural domain is
the space of probability measures, if we assign a measure
	p_S (U) = area(S \cap U) / area(S)
to each shape S.  In this way we can also discuss "fuzzy shapes,"
where membership in a shape near a boundary is not a binary
decision.
	The transport metric can be quickly calculated with linear
programming.

Another popular metric in image processing now has been studied at
Brown: the optimal diffeomorphism metric d(S_1,S_2) = 
	inf { int_{S_1} |Jp|^2 + int_{S_2} |J(p^{-1})|^2 },
where the inf is taken over all one-to-one, onto differentiable
maps p:S_1 -> S_2 with inverse p^{-1}, and J is its Jacobian.
The main problem with this metric is that two shapes identical except
for an infinitesimal tear will be infinitely far apart because they
are not topologically equivalent and admit no diffeomorphisms.
There have been extensions and changes to this metric to deal with 
these situations.

Note that the question of "what metric to use to find a distance
between shapes" is very dependent on what you're trying to do.  I
think the transport metric gives answers that are fairly close to what
humans would give, but if you're trying to find a hairline crack
defect in a machine tool, that's not a very good solution.  So
consider your needs while you're considering your metrics.

Hello, everyone...

A short time ago, I posted "3 'Simple' Quartics" to sci.math, seeking some 
_nice_ Solutions to a triple of fourth-degree Polynomials. I have received 
a few responses stating interest in the problem  (and one good reference), 
but alas no Solution.

In this post I intend to explain, in some detail, the Theory behind these
Equations, in the hopes that a complete understanding of the Problem will 
generate a good approach to the Solution.  I welcome any and all comments 
or suggestions concerning this topic (please respond by e-mail).

I realize that this article may be excessively long for a post, but I have
found myself unable to produce an "abstract" that adequately expresses the
intriguing qualities of the subject matter. It is my hope that the content  
of this article will justify its use of bandwidth.

Thanks in advance for your time.

                               HEDRONOMETRY: 

         The Search for Solutions to the Perfect Tetrahedron Equation

SUMMARY. "Hedronometry" is an extension of Trigonometry to 3-Dimensions,
         focussing on the relationships between the Angles and the Faces 
         of a Tetrahedron.  Tetrahedra have more degrees of freedom than 
         Triangles, and consequently are not uniquely determined by, say,
         the Areas of their Faces in the way that Triangles are uniquely
         determined by the Lengths of their Edges.  Yet there do exist a 
         number of Hedronometric analogues to Trigonometric formulae  -- 
         the "Neo-Pythagorean Theorem" and two "Laws of Cosines" to name
         a few -- that provide vaguely familiar relationships between the
         Faces and Angles.  These formulae are discussed first.
            
         Restricting our focus to "Perfect Tetrahedra" -- Tetrahedra for
         opposite Edges are Orthogonal (as Vectors) -- we find ourselves
         with a class of figures that _are_ uniquely determined by their 
         Face-Areas (up to permutation of the Faces, of course).  

         The "Perfect Tetrahedon Equation" -- "P.T.E." -- (of which the 
         "3 'Simple' Quartics" were versions) describes the closer ties 
         between Face-Areas and Dihedral Angles in Perfect Tetrahedra, 
         providing the key to determining the overall shape of a Tetra-
         hedron whose Face-Areas are given.  However, even though the
         P.T.E. represents a _nice_ relationship, its Solutions appear
         to be anything BUT nice. I am convinced, nevertheless, that a
         inspired simplification can be performed on the results I have
         been able to obtain, yielding forms of the Solutions that reflect
         the beauty of the Problem.  

         The challenge I set forth, then, is to find that simplification:  

    FIND THE "NICE" FORMS OF SOLUTIONS TO THE PERFECT TETRAHEDRON EQUATION.

   Note.  "Hedronometry" is by no means a new subject. I understand that
          some of the ideas presented here were developed over a century 
          ago, as aspect of "Tetrahedrometry". (I forget the name of the 
          Mathematician who published two volumes on the subject). The 2
          results I mentioned (Pyth. Thm. & Law of Cosines) can be found
          in fairly recent Journal publications (e-mail for references).
	  But I have no idea if the problem I pose or the answers I seek
          already exist in the literature.

Alright, now to begin.

NOTATION: Let the Vertices of a Tetrahedron be labelled  Q, A, B, and C.
	  The Faces (and their Areas) opposite these Vertices we denote 
          R, X, Y, and Z, respectively. An Edge (thought of as a Vector) 
          through points U and V we denote UV; thus the Edges are QA, QB, 
          QC, AB, BC, and CA.  We use "| |" for the Length of an Edge.
          Dihedral Angles we denote like the Edges, hopefully without
          confusion. 

Now although the Face-Areas X, Y, Z, and R do not define a Tetrahedron we 
do have the following:

THE NEO-PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM:

          If Tetrahedron QABC has a "Right Corner" at Q  (that is, if 
          Edges QA, QB, and QC are mutually perpendicular), then...

                            2     2     2      2
                           X  +  Y  +  Z   =  R
          
          (the Sum of the Squares of the Areas of the Leg-Faces is equal
          to the Square of the Area of the Hypotenuse-Face).

   PROOF. Exercise. It's pretty easy, requiring nothing more sophisticated
          than Heron's Formula for Triangle Area.

COMMENT 1: Sadly, the Converse of this Theorem is not true... Having the 
           "Sum of Squares" relation does not guarantee the existence of
           a Right Corner. Thus, there are "Pythagorean Tetrahedra" that
           are not "Right-Corner Tetrahedra".
 
COMMENT 2: Happily, this idea extends to 'n' Dimensions as a Theorem for
           an n-dimensional "Right-Simplex", where n mutually perpendicular 
           Edges meet at a Vertex.  But this is a story for another day.

Just as the (ordinary) Pythagorean Theorem can be viewed as a special case 
of the Law of Cosines, so the Neo-Pythagorean Theorem is a special case of...

THE FIRST LAW OF COSINES  ("LOC.1"):

             2     2   2   2  
            R  =  X + Y + Z  - 2 Y Z cos QA - 2 Z X cos QB - 2 X Y cos QC

   PROOF. Exercise.  This, too, is easy, though it involves a great deal
          of symbol manipulation and a working knowledge of the formulae
          from Spherical Trigonometry (in particular, a Law of Cosines!)
          in order to relate Dihedral Angles to "Face-Angles" like <AQB.

 COMMENT: When Q is a Right Corner, QA, QB, and QC are all Right Angles,
          so that LOC.1 reduces to the Neo-Pythagorean Theorem.

By Symmetry, we can find similar expressions for X^2, Y^2, and Z^2 in terms
of other Faces and "opposite" Dihedral Angles. The four expressions combine
to give...

THE SECOND LAW OF COSINES ("LOC.2"):

            2    2                      2     2    2
           R  + X  -  2 X R cos BC  =  H  =  Y  + Z  -  2 Y Z cos QA
 
            2    2                      2     2    2
           R  + Y  -  2 Y R cos AC  =  J  =  Z  + X  -  2 Z X cos QB

            2    2                      2     2    2
           R  + Z  -  2 Z R cos AB  =  K  =  X  + Y  -  2 X Y cos OC

COMMENT 1: Notice that Faces R & X "bound" Angle BC, and Faces Y & Z "bound"
           Angle QA;  moreover, BC and QA are "opposite" one another in the
           Tetrahedron.  Similar observations hold for the other Equations.

COMMENT 2: There is a geometric interpretation of the numbers H, J, and K.
           They are the Areas of "Pseudo-Faces", and can be calculated by:

                      <QA>x<BC>         <QB>x<CA>         <QC>x<AB> 
                  H = ---------     J = ---------     K = ---------
                          2                 2                 2

           Where 'x' is the Cross Product.  This fact isn't very important
           now, but it will aid discussion later.  Also, using H^2, J^2, 
           and K^2 as they are used in LOC.2 will help with simplification.

COROLLARY to LOC.2:
                       2     2     2     2     2     2     2
                      X  +  Y  +  Z  +  R  =  H  +  J  +  K

  PROOF. Simply set the sum of the second column from the statment of 
         LOC.2 equal to the sum of the third column, then simplify using
         the statement of LOC.1.

Okay, so now we know that all information about a Tetrahedron can be gleaned
from six Numbers:  X, Y, Z, R, H, J, and K, with the Corollary making one of 
these Numbers (you choose) unnecessary.  These Areas and "Pseudo-Areas" give
us Dihedral Angles, by LOC.2;  the Dihedral Angles give us Face-Angles, by
Spherical Trigonometry;  and Face Angles together with Face Areas give us 
lengths of Edges.  Unfortunately, all 6 of these Area Numbers are virtually 
independent of one another (but subject to a 'Triangle Inequality' of sorts).
However, with "Perfect Tetrahedra" (defined below), we get a situation in 
which X, Y, Z, and R suffice to determine all information about the Tetra-
hedron. 

DEFINITION: A _Perfect_Tetrahedron_ QABC is a Tetrahedron whose opposing
            Edges are orthogonal (when thought of as Vectors).  That is,
            if  <UV>  represents the Vector going through Points U and V
            and '.' represents the Euclidean Dot-Product, then

                     <QA>.<BC> = <QB>.<CA> = <QC>.<AB> = 0

     NOTE:  In a Perfect Tetrahedron, the Pseudo-Faces can be computed as

                      |QA||BC|       |QB||CA|       |QC||AB|
                  H = --------   J = --------   K = --------
                         2               2             2

The following Lemma and its Corollary will be useful.

    LEMMA: Let UQV be the Angle between Edges (Vectors) QU and QV.

           In a Perfect Tetrahedron QABC,

                        cos BQC       cos CQA       cos AQB
                       ---------  =  ---------  =  ---------
                          |QA|          |QB|          |QC|

    PROOF: Vector methods handle this nicely, although High School Trig
           can do the job as well.

 COROLLARY to LEMMA:

        The Face Angles at a Corner of a Perfect Tetrahedron are either
        all Acute, all Right, or all Obtuse;  further, a Perfect Tetra-
        hedron can have _at most_ one "Right" Corner or "Obtuse" Corner.

By this Corollary, we may assume that Q is not a Right Corner. Therefore,
we may use the Lemma to write:

   |QA| = k cos BQC,  |QB| = k cos CQA,  |QC| = k cos AQB,   for some  k.

Using these facts, and the formulae for the Areas of X, Y, and Z,

          |QB| |QC| sin BQC       |QC| |QA| sin CQA       |QA| |QB| sin AQB
      X = -----------------,  Y = -----------------,  Z = -----------------, 
                  2                       2                       2
                     
we can get

     X    cos CQA sin BQC                       cos QB + cos QC cos QA
    --- = --------------- = (by Spherical Trig) ----------------------
     Y    cos BQC sin CQA                       cos QA + cos QB cos QC

     Y    cos QC + cos QA cos QB    (      Z    cos QA + cos QB cos QC )
    --- = ----------------------    (and  --- = ---------------------- ) 
     Z    cos QB + cos QC cos QA    (      X    cos QC + cos QA cos QB )

Now, using the formulae for X/Y and Y/Z, as well as the Formula in LOC.1,
we can solve for cos QA, cos QB, and cos QC in terms of X, Y, Z, and R.
Thus, the Face Areas completely determine the Tetrahedron.  So, the only
thing to do is solve this system of Equations...

          ** THIS IS WHERE THE "3 'SIMPLE' QUARTICS COME IN **

NOTATION: Let A = cos QA, B = cos QB, and C = cos QC.  Then the System
          we are trying to solve looks like this...

            X    B + C A      Y    C + A B   (  Z    A + B C )
           --- = -------     --- = -------   ( --- = ------- )
            Y    A + B C      Z    B + C A   (  X    C + A B )
 
             2     2    2    2
            R  =  X  + Y  + Z  - 2 X Y C - 2 Z X B - 2 Y Z C

Maple V (Release 2) assimilates the basic idea here quite rapidly, giving 
the following "Solutions" (though in a slightly different form):

                                2   2   2   2

Of course, C is the hard part, and here our investigations come to a 
screeching halt.

The Quartic Polynomial of which C is a Root is a form of the Perfect 
Tetrahedron Equation.  Fortunately, the P.T.E. is only Quartic, so that 
it is solvable by Radicals. _Un_fortunately, the Solutions look absolutely 
hideous, even when small values are substituted in for X, Y, Z, and R.

In an attempt to simplify the Solutions, one might try to simplify the 
Equation:

One obtains a slightly less complicated version of the P.T.E. by subsituting 
                        
            2   2   2
           X + Y - K
      C = ------------ ( from the "Definition of K" in LOC.2 )  to get
             2 X Y

                        8         6   2   2   2   2   
                     3 K   -   4 K ( X + Y + Z + R )

   4 /   2   2   2   2  2       2   2     2    2         2    2     2   2 \
- K | ( X + Y + Z + R  ) - 2 ( X - R ) ( Y  - Z ) + 2 ( Y  - R ) ( Z - X ) |
     \                                                                    /

                              2   2 2   2   2 2 
                         - ( Z - R ) ( X - Y )   =  0

Observe that this is a _Quartic_ in K^2 (and it has no "linear" term...is 
this good?)  This is, essentially, one of the "3 'Simple' Quartics" from 
my previous post (although in that post I had replaced X^2 with X, Y^2 
with Y, ... , and I also made some other variable assignments in an attempt 
to simplify things).

By cycling Variables

        K -> J -> H -> K  ,   Z -> Y -> X -> Z  ,  R -> R

we can transform the K^2-Quartic to a J^2-Quartic and the H^2-Quartic, 
completing the list of "3 'Simple' Quartics".  I mention these other two 
Quartics because, while the Solutions to any _one_ of them look hopelessly
complex, we can observe that, since the Solutions must satisfy the simple
relation shown in the LOC.2 Corollary, there must be some method in the 
madness. 

To plead this case a little more convincingly, let me remind the Reader 
that any Quartic Equation
                          4     3     2
                       a q + b q + c q + d q + e = 0,

has Roots of the form
                              b
                      q =  - --- + (**STUFF**)
                             4a

Consequently, the Solutions to the three P.T.E.'s have the form

                            2   2   2   2
                      2    X + Y + Z + R
                     H  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.1**) 
                                 3

                            2   2   2   2
                      2    X + Y + Z + R
                     J  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.2**)
                                 3 

                            2   2   2   2
                      2    X + Y + Z + R
                     K  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.3**)
                                 3
                                
This gives that

    2   2   2     2   2   2   2
   H + J + K  =  X + Y + Z + R   +  **STUFF.1** + **STUFF.2** + **STUFF.3**

In accordance with the Corollary to LOC.2, we can conclude that

             **STUFF.1** + **STUFF.2** + **STUFF.3**  =  0

Now, the **STUFF**'s are pretty complicated expressions, involving complex
numbers and nested Radicals.  But as complicated as these thing are, they 
MUST cancel each other out in the end, and this is encouraging.  Somehow, 
some way, these **STUFF**'s can be artfully manipulated into expressions 
that "obviously" cancel.  I have searched for over 5 years for this method 
of artful manipulation, but to no avail.  Maple hasn't been much help in 
the general case:  I have waited for over an hour at a sitting for Maple 
to churn out even the _ugly_ Solutions to the P.T.E., but the task seems 
to require a great deal more time than I can spend waiting.

Let's take a specific example to show the extent of the problem for even 
simple numerical values:

   Assign: X = 1 , Y = 2 , Z = 5 , R = 9.  

  COMMENT: The values are chosen to avoid some special circumstances, and 
           in the hopes that they -as prime powers- might be 'recognizable' 
           inside a complicated expression.

These give the following P.T.E. system:

                      8        6          4
                   3 H  - 444 H  + 16353 H  - 2822400  =  0

                      8        6          4
                   3 J  - 444 J  + 15345 J  - 3415104  =  0

                      8        6          4
                   3 K  - 444 K  +  5265 K  -  28224   =  0

Maple solves these Equations readily.  In evaluated form, we get...

                     2                               -8
                    H  = 86.30112783 + .2120961320 10  i

                     2                               -8
                    J  = 22.08279673 - .1249277220 10  i

                     2                               -6
                    K  = 2.616075639 - .2103278201 10  i

(Of course, there are really four choices for H^2, four for J^2, and four 
for K^2, since these quantities are Roots of a Quartic.  However, one can 
easily pick out a particular set H^2, J^2, K^2 that satisfies the Corollary 
to LOC.2;  in fact the twelve total Solutions can be partitioned into four 
such sets.)

Notice that this could be simplified a little bit (although Maple doesn't 
seem to realize this fact); more importantly, observe that the **STUFF**'s 
are the fractions following the 37's in each line...and these **STUFF**'s 
have to cancel; but getting them into "obvious cancelling form" requires 
some bit of insight that I just haven't acquired.

In this numerical case, we can perhaps see better that the problem becomes 
one of "denesting" the nested Radicals. "Denesting" is a method of algebraic 
manipulation with its core in the theory of Field Extensions.  As an example,
               ____________
              /        ___     can be "denested" to     ___     ___
            \/ 5 + 2 \/ 6                             \/ 2  + \/ 3 .

Susan Landau -- in "Simplification of Nested Radicals", SIAM J. Comput., 
21 (Feb.1992) 85-110 -- explains Denesting and provides an algorithm for 
denesting arbitrarily "deep" Radical Expressions. (I freely admit that I 
do not fully comprehend the steps involved, but I have only begun to look 
into this avenue of investigation.) I am not sure if the algorithm will 
readily transfer to the general X-Y-Z-R case, since the steps require 
knowledge of Irreducible Polynomials and such things, which I should think 
would be extremely difficult to determine when dealing with variables 
instead of _numbers_.  At this point, I'd be happy to see the denested 
forms of the three Expressions above; examination of these might provide 
some valuable insight to the general case, fostering a good guess or two
that could save a lot of time.

Having mentioned time, I find that perhaps I should not waste much more of 
the Reader's.  I'll close up this post with a listing of some Special Case 
Solutions to the P.T.E.'s....Perhaps someone can discern the Grand Pattern 
from these scattered examples.  The Solutions for H^2, J^2, and K^2 are 
ordered such that repective Solutions for these three quantities satisfy 
the Corollary to LOC.2. Some of the Roots are extraneous (see discussion 
below), and '**' represent Roots that are too complicated to write out.

NOTE: I should mention something about extraneous Roots.  In the Root 
      List for each of H^2, J^2, and K^2 in the cases above, the last 
      three Roots can be considered extraneous. Let me explain.

      Notice that if  H = 0, then (by the formula given for calculating 
      H from the Cross Product) either |QA| = 0  or  |BC| = 0; so either 
      Y = Z = 0 or X = R = 0. Similarly, if J = 0, then either X = Z = 0
      or Y = R = 0;  and if  K = 0, then either  X = Y = 0 or Z = R = 0.

      Now the Triso-hedral/Equi-hedral case, the '0' Roots for the triple
      H, J, K imply that X = Y = Z = R = 0.  But in this case the formula 
      in the "first" entries of the Root List give us the answer.  Thus,
      there is no need for the '0' entries.  Moreover, the "second" entry
      is unnecessary since it simply copies the "first". 

      In the Doubly Biso-hedral case, H^2 can equal (X - R)^2 only if we
      have X = Y = Z = R = 0, which means that H's value can be computed
      from its "first" Root formula, and so can the corresponding values
      of J and K;  similarly, for when J^2 = (X - R)^2.  So the last two
      entries in these Root Lists are extraneous. Moreover, one can show
      that  X^2 + R^2 - 2sqrt(X^4 - X^2*R^2 + R^2)  is non-positive, and
      reaches zero only when X^2 = R^2; but if these are identical, then 
      the "second" Root formulae for H^2 and J^2 yield 0, so that we get
      X = Y = Z = R = 0, and find that, again, the "first" Root formulae 
      suffice.

      In the Pythagorean case, one can use arguments about Edges to show
      that the Tetrahedron _must_ be a Right-Corner Tetrahedron;  that is,
      the Neo-Pythagorean is an "if and only if" Proposition in the realm
      of Perfect Tetrahedra. (Another nice thing about Perfect Tetrahedra!) 
      Thus, A = B = C = 0, and the "first" Roots give the Solutions, so we 
      don't even need the '**'s.

      One can show that in the Flat Case, the Tetrahedron is in fact flat:
      all Faces lie in the same Plane, and the Vertex Q lies at the Ortho-
      centre of Face R. Here, H must be Y + Z, J must be X + Z, and K must
      be X + Y (by Edge arguments).  The '**' Solutions in this case are
      extraneous as well.

      Is it true in general that 3 of the Solutions for each of H^2, J^2, 
      and K^2 are extraneous?  I don't know.  Numerical experimentation has 
      always lead to twelve values (all together) which could be grouped 
      into H-J-K triplets satisfying LOC.2.  Some of the numbers have been 
      negative or even complex which _does_ make them extraneous as Area-
      Values. (In the numerical example above, it may be that the Imaginary
      components are _supposed_ to be zero.) My GUESS is that there is only 
      one valid triplet (except in special cases where we have repeated 
      Roots), and that "3/4"s of each P.T.E. contains useless information,  
      but I don't know for sure yet if that is the case.

Well, anyway, that's about all I care to inflict upon you for now.  Anyone
interested in other aspects of Hedronometry (such as its analogue in 
Hyperbolic Space among other things) should feel free to inquire.  I have
a little notebook full of bits and pieces (but nothing especially *deep*).

Let me close now by saying that, although it is *trivial* Mathematics, 
Hedronometry has been a pet project of mine since my High School Days.
I've been struggling with various forms of the P.T.E. off and on for
nearly 10 years, and I'd very much like to get its Solution pinned down.
So I appreciate all the help I can get in this matter.  Any questions,
comments, suggestions, or what-have-you's will be graciously accepted;
again, please respond by e-mail, so as not to use up even more bandwidth
on this subject.

I thank you all for your time and tolerance.

For those who have not been following this discussion, Don describes a
tetrahedron by the area of its four faces and the length of the cross
product of every pair of opposite edges, and he wants an expression for
the dihedral angles.  He has also restricted to the case where every
pair of opposite edges is perpendicular and wants the dihedral angles
in terms of the four areas.  The straightforward approach with vector
calculus in R^3 yields algebraic equations for the cosines of the
angles that seem unnecessarily complicated.

Here is another solution.  X,Y,Z, and R are your four areas, and let
cAB be the cosine of the angle between faces with area A and B.  The
key to this equation is the shadow principle:  At high noon, a plate
with area A at an angle alpha from the ground casts a shadow of area
cos(alpha) A.  By resting the tetrahedron on the ground on each 
face and applying the shadow principle, it follows that:

R = cRX X + cRY Y + cRZ Z
X = cRX R + cXY Y + cXZ Z
Y = cYX X + cRY R + cYZ Z
Z = cZX X + cZY Y + cRZ R

Now multiply each equation by the left-hand side and subtract the last
three equations from the first.

The real lesson here is that you can describe a tetrahedron by
a 4 x 4 symmetric matrix of numbers:

(     R^2, -cRX R X, -cRY R Y, -cRZ R Z)
(-cRX R X,      X^2, -cXY X Y, -cXZ X Z)
(-cRY R Y, -cXY X Y,      Y^2, -cYZ Y Z)
(-cRZ R Z, -cXZ X Z, -cYZ Y Z,      Z^2)

As long as all four rows add to zero and the matrix is positive
semidefinite (in other words v^T M v > 0 always), it corresponds to an
actual Euclidean tetrahedron.  Your three pseudo-areas (cross-products
of opposite edges) should be somewhere in this matrix also, but I have
to think about exactly where.  Finding them will hopefully solve or
at least clarify your question.

The area vector of a plane region on the boundary of a solid in 3-space  
has magnitude the area of the region and  direction the outwards normal.
The area  vectors of the faces of a solid in 3-space add up to zero,
so the sum of the area vectors of two of the faces has the same length of  
the  sum of the area vectors of the other two, and the sum of the area  
vectors of three of the faces has the same length as the area vector of  
the other. The second and first law of cosines follow. The argument  
applies   to polyhedra with any number of faces and in any dimension.
and in particular, as  Billy Don McConnell points out, to simplices in  
n-space.
I suppose this result is to be found in Grassmann's Ausdehnunglehre,  
though I've never looked.  The statement  that the area vectors add up to  
zero can be thought of as a limiting case of the statement that the  
integral of the normal vector of a smooth closed surface  with respect to  
surface area is zero, which can be deduced from Stokes's theorem. You can  
get the polyhedral case directly from a suitably formulated version of  
Stokes's theorem. Essentially it means that if fluid is flowing at a   
velocity constant in space and time, as much fluid flows out of the  
tetrahedron (or other solid) as flows into it. The vector area of the  
pseudoface tells you how much fluid crosses a surface which spans the skew  
quadrilateral which divides the tetrahedron into two triangles, if the  
fluid is flowing with unit speed and the best direction is chosen for its  
velocity vector.
I hope Billy Don McConnell will post something about  tetrahedra in  
hyperbolic space, as many people are interested in them.

From a submission which apparently never made it into the FAQ for this
newsgroup:

THE VOLUME OF SIMPLICES

Simplices (plural of ``simplex'') are convex bodies which generalize
the notions of triangles and tetrahedra to n-dimensional euclidean space,
E^n.  A k-dimensional simplex has k+1 (affinely independent) vertices,
(k+1)k/2! edges, (k+1)k(k-1)/3! two dimensional faces, and so forth up to
k+1 (k-1)-dimensional faces.  Just as triangles can exist in E^3,
k-simplices can exist in E^n for any n >= k.

Any convex polytope (the generalization of polygons and polyhedra to E^n)
can be partitioned into simplices (just as any convex polygon can be
partitioned into triangles), so in principle if you can compute the volume
of arbitrary simplices, you can compute the volume of any convex polytope.

There are several pretty and easily implemented formulae which give
the volume of a k-dimensional simplex sitting in euclidean n-space, S,
in terms of different kinds of given information, such as the coordinates
of the vertices  or the lengths of the edges.  These formulae can be used
by anyone who knows how to compute a determinant, although software such
as Mathematica will probably be needed to evaluate really large
determinants.

I will write Vol_k for ``k-dimensional volume'' (really k-dimensional
Lebesgue measure, for those who know what this means); thus Vol_1 means
length, Vol_2 means area, and so forth.  Unless stated otherwise, S
will denote a k-dimensional simplex in E^n, where n \geq k.
Vol_k(S) will mean the k-dimensional volume of S.
A hyperplane in E^n is an (n-1)-dimensional plane.

1. COMPUTING THE VOLUME OF A SIMPLEX WITH KNOWN VERTICES.

Let S have vertices given by the n-dimensional row vectors v_0, v_1, ... v_k.
Let w_1 = v_1 - v_0, w_2 = v_2 - v_0, ... w_k = v_k - v_0
and let W be the k by n matrix whose rows are the row vectors w_j,
1 \leq j \leq k.  Then the GRAM DETERMINANT FORMULA says

                            | det W W^t |^{1/2}
                Vol_k (S) = ------------------
                                    k!

where W^t is the transpose of W.  Note that W W^t is a k by k matrix,
so this formula makes sense.

2. COMPUTING THE VOLUME OF A SIMPLEX WITH KNOWN EDGE LENGTHS.

Let v_0, v_1, ... v_k be the (unknown) vertices of S and suppose
that || v_i - v_j || = d_{ij} is known.  Let D be the k+2 by k+2 matrix

                    |  0     1         1       ....    1     |
                    |  1     0      d_{01}^2   .... d_{0k}^2 |
                D = | ...             ....     ....   ....   |
                    |  1  d_{k0}^2  d_{k1}^2   ....    0     |

Then the CAYLEY-MENGER DETERMINANT FORMULA says

                              | det D |^{1/2}
                   Vol_k(S) = ---------------
                                 2^{k/2} k!

This generalizes the HERON FORMULA for the area of a triangle in terms of its
edge lengths.

3. COMPUTING THE VOLUME OF A SIMPLEX WITH KNOWN HYPERFACES.

Let S be the n-simplex in E^n whose faces are the n+1 hyperplanes
whose Cartesian equations are given by
         a_{i0} + a_{i1} x_1 + a_{i2} x_2 + ... a_{in} x_n = 0
where 0 <= i <= n.  Note that the x_j are variables standing for real
numbers and the a_{ij} are real constants.
Let A be the n+1 by n+1 matrix with elements a_{ij} and let A_{i0} be the
cofactor matrix of A with respect to a_{i0}.  Then the
KLEBANER-SUDBURY-WATTERSON DETERMINANT FORMULA says

                                    | det A |^n                
           Vol_n (S) = ---------------------------------------
                       n! det A_{00} det A_{10} ... det A_{n0}

Note this is valid only for an n-simplex in E^n.

Ok, suppose you are trying to calculate the solid angle of a tetrahedron
vertex.  Translate the vertex to the origin (i.e. subtract its
coordinates from the coordinates of the other three vertices), and
normalize the other three points (call them a,b,c) so they are all at
unit distance from the origin (e.g. if a has coordinates a1,a2,a3,
divide each coordinate by sqrt(a1^2+a2^2+a3^2)).  Then the solid angle E
can be found from the formula

E = 2 tan^{-1} (a . (b x c))/(1 + b.c + c.a + a.b)

where x is a cross product and the periods are dot products.

   You might try my web page
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/hedronometry.html

I wrote the "Hedronometry: The Search For Solutions to the Perfect
Tetrahedron Equations" post.  Thanks to David for archiving it as
part of his impressive collection.

I thought I would post two informational updates here:

First:  I am no longer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute or the
University of Washington, by the way;  my current e-mail address
is   mcconnel @ vvm . com (without the spaces ... I'm just a bit
paranoid about address-harvesters).  Incidentally, I promised
references to anyone who e-mailed me about the topic ... in the
years since the post, I've lost track of those references. Sorry.

Second:  I essentially "solved" the Perfect Tetrahedron Equations
(PTEs) recently.  At least, I solved something equivalent to the
problem posed by them:  I found a Heron-like formula that gives
the volume of a perfect tetrahedron in terms of the areas of its
faces.  (A "perfect" tetrahedron is one whose pairs of opposite
edges determine pairs of orthogonal vectors.)  With face areas
and volume known, various substitutions into other formulae can
yield things like dihedral and face angles, and areas of "pseudo-
faces" (the primary target of the previously posted PTEs);  thus,
all aspects of a Perfect Tetrahedron are derivable from the areas
of its faces.

My solution isn't explicit, but is encoded in a single quartic,
instead of the four I'd given before;  the one quartic is far more
complicated to express than the other four, but I haven't done a
great deal of analysis to see what I can fix up.

Here 'tis:

   Let X, Y, Z, and R  be the areas of faces of a perfect
   tetrahedron, and let  W = 81 * volume^4 .  Then  W  is the
   root of the following "Heron Quartic":

 0 = 27 W^4

  - W^3 * (        << 6, 0, 0, 0 >>  -  33 << 4, 2, 0, 0 >>  )
          (  + 114 << 2, 2, 2, 0 >>                          )

  - W^2 * (        <<10, 2, 0, 0 >>  -   4 << 8, 4, 0, 0 >>  )
          (  -  43 << 8, 2, 2, 0 >>  +   6 << 6, 6, 0, 0 >>  )
          (  +  42 << 6, 4, 2, 0 >>  + 408 << 6, 2, 2, 2 >>  )
          (  - 204 << 4, 4, 4, 0 >>  - 218 << 4, 4, 2, 2 >>  )

  - W   * (        <<14, 2, 2, 0 >>  -   6 <<12, 4, 2, 0 >>  )
          (  -  57 <<12, 2, 2, 2 >>  +  15 <<10, 6, 2, 0 >>  )
          (  +  18 <<10, 4, 4, 0 >>  + 165 <<10, 4, 2, 2 >>  )
          (  -  20 << 8, 8, 2, 0 >>  -  12 << 8, 6, 4, 0 >>  )
          (  + 109 << 8, 6, 2, 2 >>  - 398 << 8, 4, 4, 2 >>  )
          (  -   6 << 6, 6, 6, 0 >>  + 478 << 6, 6, 4, 2 >>  )
          (  - 324 << 6, 4, 4, 4 >>                          )

  - X^2 Y^2 Z^2 R^2 (X+Y+Z-R)^2 (X+Y-Z+R)^2 (X-Y+Z+R)^2 (-X+Y+Z+R)^2
                  * (X+Y-Z-R)^2 (X-Y+Z-R)^2 (X-Y-Z+R)^2 ( X+Y+Z+R)^2

(I hope I've caught all of the typos.)

Here, <<a, b, c, d>> := SUM A^a B^b C^c D^d , with the sum taken
over all permutations ABCD of XYZR.

Although the cubic, quadratic, and linear coefficients are fairly
unenlightening when expanded in this way, I'll point out that the
constant term expands to something far worse;  I'm hoping that the
other coefficients can be "reasonably" expressed in a more compact
form.  (Again, I haven't given it much thought.)

I suspect that at most one of the four roots are real and non-negative
for non-degenerate tetrahedra.  This is certainly the case in the
special cases, which I'll list below:

                              - 256 P^4 Q^4 (P^2-Q^2)^2 ) = 0
     Volume:  V = 0 (double root)
              V^4 = 2^4/3^7 ( -2 P^6 + 3 P^4 Q^2 + 3 P^2 Q^4 - 2 Q^6

This may not be of any use to you, but here's an old post on this 
subject.  It's interesting that this approach seems to invariably 
lead to a quartic equation (although yours is the first I've seen 
where the quartic is in terms of the volume itself, rather than
one of the edge lengths).  

================================================================
In general there is no complete generalization of Heron's formula
giving the volume of a general tetrahedron in terms of the areas
of its faces, because the face areas don't uniquely determine the
volume (in contrast to the case of triangles, where the three
edge lengths determine the area).

However, it IS possible to derive a "Heron's formula" for 
tetrahedrons if we restrict ourselves to just those that would 
fit as the "hypotenuse face" of a right 4D solid.  (Notice that 
EVERY triangle is the face of a right tetrahedron, which explains
why Heron's formula is complete for triangles).

To review, remember that Heron's formula for triangles is essentially
equivalent to Pythagoras' Theorem for right tetrahedrons.  If A_xyo,
A_xoz, and A_oyz denote the areas of the three orthogonal faces of a
right tetrahedron, and A_xyz denotes the area of the "hypotenuse 
face", then it's easy to show that

   (A_xyz)^2  =  (A_xyo)^2  +  (A_xoz)^2  +  (A_oyz)^2         (1)

This is not only a generalization of Pythagoras's Theorem, it's also
essentially Heron's formula for triangles.  Note that if a,b,c denote
the three orthogonal edge lengths of the tetrahedron, then the areas
A_xyo, A_xoz, and A_oyz are simply  ab/2, ac/2, and bc/2. Furthermore,
the edges of the hypotenuse face d,e,f are directly related to a,b,c
according to the 2D Pythagorean theorem

                     a^2 + b^2  = d^2
                     a^2 + c^2  = e^2                         (2)
                     b^2 + c^2  = f^2

so we can express the squares of the areas A_xyo, A_xoz, A_oyz in
equation (1) in terms of d^2, e^2, and f^2 to give the ordinary
Heron's formula explicitly.

Incidentally, it might be (and has been) argued that this derivation
does not apply to obtuse triangles, because the "hypotenuse face" of
a right tetrahedron is necessarily acute (i.e., each of its angles 
must be less than 90 degrees).  However, ANY triangle can be the 
hypotenuse face of a right tetrahedron, provided the orthogonal edge
lengths and areas are allowed to be imaginary.  (It's interesting
to speculate on whether the ancient Greeks might have been aware of 
this aspect of the problem.)

Anyway, we can do the same thing for tetrahedrons based on the
generalized Pythagorean theorem for volumes of *right* 4D solids

 (V_wxyz)^2 = (V_wxyo)^2 + (V_wxoz)^2 + (V_woyz)^2 + (V_oxyz)^2   (3)

If we let a,b,c,d denote the orthogonal edge lengths of the 4D
solid, then the volumes of the four orthogonal "faces" are simply
abc/6, abd/6, acd/6, and bcd/6, so equation (3) can be rewritten
as

 (V_wxyz)^2 = (abc/6)^2 + (abd/6)^2 + (acd/6)^2 + (bcd/6)^2      (3')

Also, the areas of the four faces of our "hyoptenuse" solid can be 
expressed in terms of a,b,c,d by means of the 3D Pythagorean theorem

         (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2 = 4(A_1)^2
         (ab)^2 + (ad)^2 + (bd)^2 = 4(A_2)^2                     (4)
         (ac)^2 + (ad)^2 + (cd)^2 = 4(A_3)^2
         (bc)^2 + (bd)^2 + (cd)^2 = 4(A_4)^2

Thus, given the four face areas A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, we have four
equations in the four unknowns a,b,c,d, so we can solve for these
values and then compute the area using (3').

This is the point at which people usually turn away from this
approach, for two reasons: [1] everything we're doing is restricted
to the special tetrahedrons that can serve as the hypotenuse of a 
"right" 4D simplex, so we're certainly not going to end up with a 
general formula applicable to every tetrahedron (and such formulas 
are already available anyway via the usual determinants), and [2] it
turns out to be somewhat messy to solve the set of equations (4).

Pressing on anyway, we can reduce (4) to a single quartic in the
square of any of the four variables a,b,c or d.  Arbitrarily
selecting c, and letting A,B,C,D denote 4 times the squares of
the face areas (i.e., the right hand sides of equations (4)),
we can express the quartic in x=c^2 with coefficients that are
functions of B and the elementary symmetric functions of A,C,D

       s1 = A+C+D       s2 = AC+AD+CD      s3 = ACD

In these terms the quartic for x=c^2 is

                                                  [12B] x^4 
                       +   [3s1^2 - 12s2 + 14Bs1 - B^2] x^3
     +  [2B(s1^2 + 6s2) - B^2 s1 - s1^3 + 4s1s2 - 36s3] x^2
 + [2B(s1s2 + 6s3) - B^2 s2 + 4s2^2 - s1^2 s2 - 12s1s3] x
                                        - [s3 (s1-B)^2]   =   0

Of course, the analagous quartics can be given for a^2, b^2, and
d^2, but once we have any one of them we can more easily compute
the others.  For example, given c we can compute b from the relation
                          ___________________
                         / (c^2 + A)(c^2 + D)
           b = -c  +-   / -------------------
                      \/      (c^2 + C)

and the values of a and d follow easily, allowing us to compute
the volume using equation (3').  It would be nice if we could express
the volume as an explicit function of the face areas, but I don't
know if such a formula exists.

The only solutions I have been able to find involve the smaller and
larger boxes sharing a common long diagonal; the best of these solutions
orients the smaller box 180degrees rotated around that diagonal, with
side length 3/5 that of the larger box.  Six of the vertices of the smaller
box are on the faces of the larger box, 3/5 of the way along the face
diagonals; the remaining two vertices are 1/5 and 4/5 of the way along
the long diagonal of the longer box.  (If this is too confusing, see
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.gif for a picture.)

Are there any solutions in which the two boxes do not share a diagonal?

Remember your question from a year ago, about how to place a small cube
inside a unit cube, so that all the unit cube's faces are touched?
I replied with a set of solutions in which the two cubes share a long
diagonal; in the smallest of these solutions the small cube's size is
3/5 that of the large one.

Anyway, I finally went through a rather ugly proof that these are the
only possible solutions.  The method was to express the requirements
that certain small cube vertices be on the planes of the large cube's
faces in terms of a system of polynomial equations, use Mathematica to
find all families of solutions of these equations, and check that each
solution either has the form I already knew about (with the two cubes
sharing a diagonal) or doesn't work geometrically (for instance,
solutions involving complex numbers).

I've put my calculations online at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.nb
if you care to examine them (I'd be just as happy if you didn't;
as I said, they're not pretty).

Yes, same here.  But the 4d case is perhaps more symmetric since you
have 8 cubical faces and 16 vertices, and for a 4d cube there is a very
clear meaning to "every other" vertex.   But I don't think you can get

OH, DUH.
This idea of taking every other vertex makes it very easy.

The convex hull of every other vertex is a 16-cell (4-dimensional
analogue of an octahedron).  You can also get a 16-cell by taking the
center point of every face of the cube.

So probably the correct answer is to inscribe the small cube so that
every other vertex is at the center of a face of the large cube.

(This is still guesswork, I haven't even verified that the other faces
of the small cube stay inside the large cube.)

PPS it is very easy to see that putting every other vertex of the small
cube at the face centers of the large cube works, and that it is optimal.

Since each opposite pair of vertices of the small cube form a diameter
of the small cube, perpendicular to the large cube's faces, there is no
way to get a pair of vertices touching parallel planes farther apart
than the large cube's faces, and for similar reasons the other 8
vertices of the small cube can't touch or be outside the large cube.

Let the large box's coordinates be (+-1, +-1, +-1, +-1).
Then the eight small box vertices that touch the large box's faces
have coordinates that are permutations of (0, 0, 0, +-1).
To get the other eight vertices, take every other corner of
the hypercube (+-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2) (a shrunken copy of the
large cube). The small cube has half the side length of the large one.

Actually there are two different ways of inscribing the small cube in
the large one, depending on which set of every other vertex of the
shrunken cube you take.  These two small inscribed cubes, together with
the cube (+-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2) itself, form a very nice complex
of three cubes in which each pair of two cubes shares the eight vertices
of a 16-cell.  The whole set of 24 vertices of this complex forms
another regular 4-polytope, the 24-cell, which is self-dual and has 24
octahedral faces.

Spiral Tilings

Spiral Tilings

The usual definition of a tiling
involves a partition of space into pieces that are congruent to
each other, but there has been some study of similarity
tilings in which this congruence requirement is relaxed, so
that the tiles need only be similar to each other. One possible way
of forming such tilings is to arrange the tiles in a spiral:




A well-known example of such a spiral tiling is formed by
squares, with adjacent squares in the spiral having sizes in the
golden ratio to each other.



A related tiling using a 1 by sqrt(2) rectangle is the basis for
European paper size standards, and K. S. Brown's page on "the golden
triangle" hints at the existence of another tiling with
equilateral triangles the size ratio of which is a root of the
polynomial x3-x-1. Brown's web site also
includes a description of another spiral tiling
by 30-60-90 right triangles.

What is a good definition of a spiral tiling? What shapes can be
used as the tiles in spiral tilings? How many neighbors can each
tile have? What are the symmetries of these tilings?

Complex Numbers

A spiral is formed by a combination of two simultaneous motions:
expansion and twisting around the center of the spiral. 

The same combination of motions arises in multiplying complex
numbers a+bi. If we think of these numbers as forming
a plane, then multiplying all the points of any configuration in
that plane by a+bi can be carried out geometrically,
by expanding the configuration away from the origin by a factor of
sqrt(a2+b2), and simultanously
twisting the configuration around the origin by an angle of
tan-1(a/b).

For this reason it makes sense to use complex number
multiplication to represent the symmetries of a spiral tiling.

Definitions

We define a tile to be an open connected subset of the
complex number plane.

We define a tiling to be a set of disjoint tiles, the
closure of which covers the entire complex number plane.

We define a complex symmetry of a tiling to be a complex
number such that multiplying each tile by that number produces
another tile of the same tiling.

We define a spiral tiling to be a tiling in which for any
two tiles s and t, some complex symmetry of the
tiling maps s to t.

The last definition can be rephrased as saying that the
symmetries act transitively on the tiles. Note that these
definitions are different from the notion of a spiral tiling used
by Grünbaum and Shephard [Tilings and Patterns, W.H. Freeman
1987, pp. 512-516], which does not involve similarity and is
generally rather less well-defined than the above (the "I know it
when I see it" test applies). Some material closer to what we have
here can be found in the same book [pp. 520-522].

Uniqueness of Tile Mappings

We know from the definition that, for any two tiles s and
t in a spiral tiling, some complex number z satisfies
the set-theoretic equation s*z=t. Can there be more
than one such z? 

Consider the distances d(s) and d(t) of each from
the origin. Since complex multiplication acts on these distances,
the magnitude of z must be d(t)/d(s). What
about its orientation?

Suppose s*y=s*z=t. Then
s*(z/y)=s, so s is invariant by some rotation
about the origin. The only such tiles can be annuli in which the
two boundary components are similarly invariant and similar to each
other.



We treat this case as degenerate; from now on we assume that it
does not occur in our tilings. So in a non-degenerate spiral
tiling, the symmetry z mapping s to t is
uniquely defined. We denote this symmetry by t/s.

Symmetries of Spiral Tilings

The symmetries of a spiral tiling, like any other collection of
symmetries, form a group: the product of two symmetries is
another symmetry, as is the inverse of any symmetry, and products
are associative. The group product here is just complex number
multiplication. Because of the uniqueness of the mapping from one
tile to another, the group must be discrete: any symmetry
z has a neighborhood in the complex number plane that
contains only that symmetry. For, if z maps some point 
x in the interior of tile s to the corresponding point
in the interior of tile t, any other complex number
sufficiently near z would also map x into the
interior of tile t, by continuity of complex multiplication.
We can summarize this conclusion by saying that the group G of
symmetries of a spiral tiling must be a discrete subgroup of
multiplication of nonzero complex numbers. 

 If we choose a reference point 1 in some tile containing that
point, the images of that point 1*G=G give one reference point in
each tile, so the members of G are in one-to-one correspondence
with the tiles of the spiral tiling. We can think of each tile as
forming a canonical neighborhood or fundamental domain
around each symmetry z.

The Exponential Map

The function exp(z) has the nice property that it translates
addition to multiplication:
exp(y+z)=exp(y)*exp(z). The inverse
function log(z) should therefore translate multiplication to
addition, so we can use it to understand the multiplicative
symmetry group G in terms of the simpler addition operation. 

There is a slight complication: exp(z) is not one-to-one,
since exp(z)=exp(z+2pi). Therefore a more-or-less
arbitrary choice has to be made about which value to use as the
inverse. In our case, we are interested in set-theoretic inverses,
so we use the notation log(G) to denote the set { z :
exp(z) in G }.

Then if G is a multiplicative subgroup of the complex numbers,
log(G) is an additive subgroup. And if G is a discrete set, log(G)
is also discrete. So if G is the set of symmetries of a spiral
tiling, log(G) is a discrete subgroup of the additive complex
numbers. There are only two possibilities for what such a subgroup
can look like: either it is a 
lattice, or it is the set of integer multiples Kz of
a single generator z.

Note finally that 2 pi i is a member of log(G), since it is in
log(1). So if log(G) is a lattice, it is a lattice containing the
vector 2 pi i. And if log(G) is of the form Kz, then 
z must be purely imaginary, so G (which consists of the powers
of exp(z)) must consist purely of rotations. If so, we have
another degenerate case in which some finite number of infinite
wedges tile the plane by fitting together at the origin.



Therefore from now on, we can assume that any non-degenerate
spiral tiling is of the form exp(T) where T is a periodic
(congruence) tiling having a translation by 2 pi i among its
lattice of translational symmetries.

Neighborhoods in Spiral Tilings

How many tiles can surround a given tile in a spiral tiling? By
transitivity of the symmetry group, the answer is independent of
which tile is chosen. Some manipulation with Euler
characteristics shows that the number of neighbors can only be
two, four, or six. 

In more detail, if one glues the edges of the tile together in a
pattern formed by how it connects to its neighbors, one gets a 
manifold, a space which near each point "looks like" the plane.
The analysis above, showing that the tiling comes from applying the
exponential map to a periodic tiling, shows that this manifold must
be topologically equivalent to a torus, so Euler's formula tells us
that V-E+F=0, where F is the number of faces in the manifold (just
one), E is the number of edges, and V is the number of vertices.
Now if the tile has k neighbors, it contributes k sides of edges to
E, but each edge has two sides so E=k/2 and k must be even.
Further, each vertex has at least three ends of edges, and each
edge has two ends, so 2E<=3V, which combined with Euler's
formula E=V+1 implies that E<=3.

The case that k=2 gives us our third type of degenerate tiling.
This case occurs when the lattice log(G) is generated by the two
values pi i and x for some real x, so the only
symmetries of the tiling are expansions (without rotation) and
reflection through the origin. The tiles in this degenerate case
must be infinite strips, the two boundaries of which are similar to
each other.



In the remaining cases, the tiles are combinatorially equivalent
to quadrilaterals or hexagons (they may take other shapes,
including triangles and pentagons, but they have either four or six
neighbors, and are adjacent to four or six vertices where more than
two tiles meet). This is a key difference from periodic tilings,
which also allow tiles with three neighbors.

Which Quadrilaterals Tile?

We now discuss necessary conditions for a polygon to form a spiral
tiling. Because of the analysis above, the most important polygons
to consider are quadrilaterals and hexagons. We don't consider
triangles and pentagons separately, as in any spiral tiling such a
polygon would have to have vertices placed along its sides, and
could therefore be considered a type of quadrilateral or hexagon
with certain angles equal to pi. 

As described by Thurston [Three-Dimensional Geometry and
Topology, unpublished manuscript, 1990, p. 137] any quadrilateral
can be fitted into similar copies of itself in a way that locally
looks like part of a spiral tiling. This construction is known as
the "developing map" and is a special case of a construction that
works for arbitrary manifolds. However, there are some nonlocal
requirements on the shape of quadrilaterals that form spiral
tilings. If one applies the developing map construction to an
arbitrary quadrilateral, the result usually overlaps itself or has
cracks that can not be filled.



The space of all quadrilateral shapes can be specified by four
parameters (e.g. two angles and two edge lengths). It seems that
the requirement that the developing map meets up with itself
corresponds to a restriction to a two-dimensional subspace of the
quadrilateral shapes. Is there a reasonable way to describe that
subspace?

Which Hexagons Tile?

One method of investigating spiral tilings of hexagons is to
observe that, since any such tiling is the exponential image of a
periodic tiling, it has a fundamental quadrilateral. There is no
loss of generality in assuming that the vertices of this
quadrilateral are vertices of the hexagonal tiling. 



So it must be possible to 
dissect the hexagon into pieces that can be reassembled
(allowing similarity) into a quadrilateral that forms a spiral
tiling. One simple necessary condition for the tiling to exist is
that one must be able to group the hexagon vertices into two
triples, each triple adding to 2 pi. Do these two triples have to
alternate around the hexagon, as they do in the tiling above? What
other conditions are necessary?

Summary

We have defined spiral similarity tilings in terms of a transitive
group of complex multiplications. After identifying three possible
degenerate forms of tiling (nested annuli, finitely many infinite
wedges, and infinitely many infinite strips) we showed that the
remaining spiral tilings have tiles combinatorially equivalent to
quadrilaterals meeting four at a vertex, or hexagons meeting three
at a vertex. These tilings are generated by applying the
exponential map to periodic tilings with certain restrictions on
the lattice of translational symmetries. Finally, we began a
preliminary classification of the quadrilaterals and hexagons that
form spiral tilins.

Subject:        More on the area of the Mandelbrot Set
Date:           25 Feb 91 07:43:14 GMT
Organization:   HP Corp Computing & Services

At the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past
weekend, John Ewing gave an interesting talk called "Can We See the
Mandlebrot Set".  (He avoided using both the "C" word and the "F" word
after the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or
fractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he
discussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the
last month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set
using lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of
the area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,
and seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and
more accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.
Both these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in
the limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get
closer if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the
series.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One
possibility is that the pixal method misses "hairs" around the border.
(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't
taking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number
being possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,
which of these numbers represents the "real" area (although it is
believed that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references
(I asked afterwards.)

I know almost nothing about this, but see an article by Ewing and Schober,
something like "On the Coefficients of the Reciprocal of the Mandelbrot Set"
in "Mathematical Analysis and Applications". It seems the area of the Mandel-
brot set is bounded above by 

         Infinity
pi*( 1 - Sum      n* b(n)^2  )
         n=1

where b(n) are the coefficients of the power series mapping the unit circle
to the exterior of the Mandelbrot set. It converges very slowly (the 
terms of the series are very irregular, can be found recursively, and
asymptotically behave as O(n^(-5/4) ). I believe that adding a quarter 
million terms yields an area approximately of 1.72  (1.75? something like
that); this is interesting because huge scale Monte Carlo runs bound the
area at about 1.53 (or thereabouts). I've tried accelerating the power series
based on the first 20 or so terms, but haven't had any luck.

As for the centroid question...the centroid is the center of area, right?
If so, it'll be on the real axis (Mandelbrot is symmetric), and can be ap-
proximated roughly by finding the "center of mass" of the big cardioid, 
big circle, and the two largish (above/below the cardioid) bulbs all 
together.

Take all this cautiously. If anyone's interested, let me know and I'll
dig out a more complete reference list and post it here (these were the 
highlights).

There was a (fairly) recent article on this 1.5/1.75 in the Monthly or
Math. Mag. that was interesting.  Noone knows, but it's clearly an object
with a well-defined, finite (it's a subset of a disk of radius two) area.
Don't know about the centroid...

Ah, the old MSet area problem. I compute the area is at least 1.505936.

Three years ago a bunch of us (66) who read sci.fractals computed upper 
and lower bounds. We found it is more than 1.5031197 and no greater than 
1.5613027. See Y. Fisher and J. Hill, Bounding the Area of the Mandelbrot 
Set, Numerische Mathematik,. (Submitted for publication). Available via

It's somewhere around -0.288, by straight Monte Carlo. The area is about
1.52, by the same argument.

The area of the cardioid is 3pi/8 with centroid at -1/6.
The circle has area 1/16 centered at -1. The combined centroid
is -2/7.  Pixel counting (I can't believe I wrote that) gets me
the centroid near -0.288, still close enough to -2/7 to wonder....

  Another approach might be to find the centroids (or areas, or whatever)
of the various iterates of z^2 + c.  Is there an analytic technique to
determine the centroid of such a figure (defined by |p(c)| == 2 for some
polynomial p)?  Is the desired centroid the limit of the resulting sequence?

The standard deviation measures how much (on average) each
run differs from the average. This means that the average
itself almost certainly varys even less from the true area.
For 20 samples, the standard error of the mean is about 0.23
of the standard deviation. A safe estimate of the error
would be about 1/3 of the standard deiation.

(My old estimate, from April 13th 1993, was 1.506595
+- 0.000002. That estimate was based on an average of 40
runs, and used a dwell limit of 524288. I should have
subtracted 0.000005 to account for the error in using such
a low dwell limit; I also was a little too "liberal" in my
calculation of the expected error.)

The area of the Mandelbrot set is between 1.5 and 1.71.  Here are
some messages on the topic collected from usenet two years ago.

The area of the Mandelbrot set is 

    A = (1 - sum (n=1 to infinity) n (b_n)^2) Pi

or approximately 2.089.

Here the numbers  b_n  are the coeffients of the Laurent series about
infinity of the conformal map  psi  of the exterior of the unit disk
onto the exterior of the Mandelbrot set:

  psi(w) = w +  sum (n=0 to infinity)  b_n w^(-n)
  
         = w - (1/2) + (1/8) w^(-1) - (1/4) w^(-2) + (15/128) w^(-3)
                 
           + 0 w^(-4) - (47/1024) w^(-5) + ...
                 
These coefficients can be computed recursively, but a closed form
is not known.  The above approximation comes from using the first
72 terms of the series.

A formula for computing the area of the Mandelbrot set was discussed on
this newsgroup recently.  Gerald Edgar posted an area estimate based on
72 terms.  Yuval Fisher pointed out that a 256-term estimate gives a
much lower value, and he described how to compute coefficients in the area
series.

Using Yuval's suggestion, I computed over 100,000 terms of the series.
The estimate converges very slowly -- a summary appears below.  An
inportant point is that every truncation of the series is an 
*upper bound* on the area of M.  Based on the trend I'd say the true 
area is probably less than 1.70, but I won't bet my firstborn on that.

Organization:   HP Corp Computing & Services

At the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past
weekend, John Ewing gave an interesting talk called "Can We See the
Mandlebrot Set".  (He avoided using both the "C" word and the "F" word
after the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or
fractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he
discussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the
last month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set
using lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of
the area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,
and seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and
more accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.
Both these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in
the limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get
closer if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the
series.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One
possibility is that the pixal method misses "hairs" around the border.
(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't
taking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number
being possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,
which of these numbers represents the "real" area (although it is
believed that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references
(I asked afterwards.)

There was some discussion a while back about the area of the
Mandelbrot set.  I just noticed the following article:

        J. H. Ewing and G. Schober, The area of the Mandelbrot set,
        Numer. Math. 61 (1992), 59-72.

It may be of interest.

The article computes the area estimate using 240,000 terms.  The result
is 1.7274...  The behovior of the approximations suggests that the limit
is between 1.66 and 1.71.  However, the estimates of the area from below,
using pixel counting show that the area is at least 1.52.  The large
gap between the lower bound 1.52 and the upper bound 1.71 may possibly
be an indication that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has
positive area...

The Ewing and Schober paper cited also explains the computation of
the coefficients b_m in the series.

  I have done some refined pixel counting and
my best result is
 Total Mset area=  1.499936.
On this basis I conjecture that the exact value is 3/2.
However, this number is not universal in the way that the feigenvalues are,
since it varies with reparameterization of the map z^2+c.   I have also
done z^d+c (d=3,4,5..), with no clear pattern yet.

So let's get started. We can for each period, p, count around
the Cardioid.  Let's name the buds (i,p), the i-th bud with
period p.

n:=0;
for p:=1 to inf do
  for i:=1 to p do
    n:=n+1;

But we find we already counted some. For example, (2,4) is
the same bud as (1,2).  The modified loop is

n:=0; m:=0;
for p:=1 to inf do
  for i:=1 to p do
    if gcd(i,p)=1 then
      n:=n+1
    else
      m:=m+1;

where m will count the duplicates. To count the buds on buds,
we must make this algorithm recursive. When we are done, we
can also count the island Mandelbroties, l. They will be

l = 2^p - (n+m) - Mandelbrotie buds.

Table I shows the results of this calculation.  We can also
keep a running total of the number of buds.  The total for
each doubling of the period is shown in Table II.  The last
column shows the ratio of the total with each doubling which
approaches 5.56.  An approximate formula for the total is

  Total buds, T = 5.56^(ln2(p/2)) = 5.56^(-1+1.442695*ln(p))
                = exp( 2.46*ln(p)-1.7 )

The density of buds is approximately

  dT/dp = (0.45/p)*exp( 2.46*ln(p) )

Now if we use Milnor's bud radius formula r=sin(pi*i/p)/(p*p),
we can estimate the area of the Cardioid plus attached buds.
The formula is not good for buds on buds, however if I use it
anyway, the area approaches 1.507818.  I must point out the
formula is quite inaccurate, with error as large as 100%.
Therefore, measured radii for p less than 11 were substituted
in the revised area estimate, Table III, which approaches
1.504106.  This is approximate since the bud radii (area) for
periods beyond 2 are still unknown.

The importance of the bud area as a function of p can be
gauged the total area of all buds and cardioids as a function
of p.  An estimate based on 'pixel counting' is shown in Table
IV.  The values for p=1,2 can be compared to the exact values.

A(1) = 3*pi/8 = 1.178097245 (calculated=1.17809694),

A(2) =  pi/16 = 0.196349541 (calculated=0.19634926).

Their error is about 3e-7.  The calculation used 8192x4096
samples in region (-2,-1.125),(0.5,1.125) with an iteration
limit of 8388608.  Period detection was used for early exit.
When a period was found, an additional set of iterations were
used with a fuzzy period test to distinguish the real period
from a multiple.  A simultaneous graphic display showed the
errors in the period selection to be very few.  The undecideds
after 8388608 iterations were counted.  Only 73 samples out
of 8987185 were unable to decide to exit or find a period.
We can see from Table IV that accurate estimates of bud radii
will be needed up to p=48 if we want 5 or 6 digit accuracy.
That is 2417 buds on the main Mandelbrot, not an impossible
task.  8^)   |-0   >^]   |-(  (Are we having fun yet?)  ;^)

Subject:        Mandelbrot Set center-of-gravity is -((ln(3)-1/3)^Feig)
Date:           Wed, 04 Mar 1998 14:36:24 -0600

Recently I restarted the computing effort I undertook
about a year ago to
compute the area of the Mandelbrot
Set. After reviewing the notes from that
time I saw that there had
been some interest in the past of computing the
Mandelbrot Set's
"center of gravity" as well. I have also done some
optimizations of
the code in the mean time and fixed a few bugs, and have
started
doing a long run.

The method I use involves counting pixels on a
grid. There is error
in the estimate resulting from grid placement and the
fact that the
grid squares on the boundary get counted as completely in or
completely out when in fact only part of their area is in. It is hard
to
estimate the magnitude of this error, so I use statistical methods
to measure
it. I use a bunch of grids of slightly different grid
spacings with slight
vertical and horizontal offsets, and take the
mean and standard deviation of
all the runs.

These are the figures I've compiled so far. Each run is the
average
of 20 grids for which the standard deviations are shown.

For each average, the standard deviation gives the expected error
in
each of the 20 individual grids. The expected error of the mean
is 1/sqrt(19)
of the standard deviation (this is called "the standard
error of the mean").
I use 1/3 as a conservative estimate. So, my
best estimate of the
center-of-gravity is -0.28676832 +- 0.00000010.
For the area, we have
1.50659173 +- 0.00000020.

The Inverse Symbolic Calculator is a resource at
the URL

  http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html

which can be
used to guess what expression produces a given numeric
value. I plugged in
the values 1.50659173 and 0.28676832. I saw
nothing interesting for the area
but for the center of gravity it
gives

  -((ln(3)-1/3) ^ Feig1).

Feig1 is
the larger Faigenbaum constant, whose value is
4.6692016091029906718532038,
and shows up in the Mandelbrot Set as
the ratio of the radii of successive
mu-atoms on the real axis.
Plugging in this value we get the following
hypothetical precise
value of the Mandelbrot Set's center of gravity:

-0.2867682633829350268529586

A few other observations:

- My program
currently runs at about 2.39 million Mandelbrot iterations
  per second (each
iteration requires 7 floating-point operations).
  The latest model Macs are
about 4 times faster. Intel machines get
  nowhere close because they don't
have enough floating-point registers
  to keep the pipeline full.

- Each
time I double the grid size it takes almost 4.7 times as long.
  The current
rate of progress in computer performance is
  about 1.56 per year; at that
rate it takes about 3.5 years
        to increase computing power by 4.7.

- Each
time the gridsize is doubled the error goes down to about 0.4
        of the
previous value (but it varies from 0.3 to 0.55). It would take
  about 8 to
10 years for personal computers to improve enough to give
  us one more digit
in the area estimate (given the same run time).

As far as I know, this is still an open problem.  This problem is stated
on p. 265-6 of Joseph O'Rourke's book "Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms."
He states "The original poser of the problem is unknown; Klee 
popularized the problem in two articles" (which are:
"Is every polygonal region illuminable from some point?"
          Amer. Math. Monthly 76 (1969), 180.
"Some unsolved problems in plane geometry," 
          Math. Mag. 52 (1979), 131-145.).
 
For those of you without access to O'Rourke's book, here are the precise
problems, and what is known about them:

"Let P be a polygon and imagine that all of its edges are perfect mirrors.
Is there always at least one interior point from which P is completely 
illuminable by a point light bulb?  Is P always illuminable from
_each_ of its points?  Assume that the light bulb sends out rays in all
directions, and that the standard 'angle of reflection = angle of
incidence' law of reflection holds.  Further assume that a light ray is 
absorbed if it hits a vertex.  Surprisingly, these problems are unsolved for
polygons. However, Klee showed the answers to be 'no' if curved
(differentiable) arcs are permitted."  

(In the book are two figures with curved arcs.  One shows a region that
is not illuminable from a point x, but is illuminable from another point y.
Basically x is at the center of 2 semicircles, the upper one having a
larger radius than the lower one and there are some bays between the
two arcs.  You can use your imagination to reconstruct it from the following:
                .---------------------.   
               /           y           \ <== top circular arc
               |                       |
               |                       |
               |                       |
                \_ _/|     x     |\_ _/  <== bay
                     |           |
                      \_________/   <== bottom circular arc

The other shows a region that is not illuminable from any of its points.
There are two elliptical arcs with foci (a,b) and (a',b') and some bays.
Any light source above the a'b' major axis will not illuminate regions
A' or B', and similarly for below the ab axis.  And a light source in A
will bounce into B and back again, never illuminating A' or B'.
You can use your imagination to reconstruct it from the following:
                .--------------------------.   
               /                            \ <== top elliptical arc

               \                            / <== bottom elliptical arc
                \__________________________/   
).

O'Rourke goes on to say:

"Although the problem remains unsolved for polygonal regions, some progress
has been made in understanding the behavior of single light rays in a
_rational_ polygon, one whose angles are all rational multiples of $\Pi$.
(Orthogonal polygons are a very special case of rational polygons.)  A
single light ray is more usually called a "billiard ball" in the now rather
substantial literature on the subject...

Theorem 10.4 [Boldrighini et al. 1978' Kerckhoff et al. 1985].  Let x be
a point in a rational polygon P and $\Theta$ a direction.  Then, except
for a countable number of "exceptional" directions $\Theta$, the path of
a billiard ball issuing from x in the direction $\Theta$ is spatially dense
in P, that is, passes arbitrarily lose to every point of P.

One implication of this result is that every rational polygon is 
illuminable from each of its points in the sense that no finite area
region will be left unilluminated;  whether an isolated point could remain
in the dark is unclear.

For irrational polygons, almost nothing is known.  It is not even known 
if every triangle admits a dense billiard path."

A related question that has bothered me for many years is whether it is 
possible to build a toroidal polyhedron out of equilateral triangles,
with six triangles at each vertex.

I suspect not but have been unable to settle it.

A similar question arises if the restriction to "six triangles at each vertex"
is removed. This seems likely to be true.

Suppose you make a buckyball (truncated icosohedron, soccer ball)
in hyperbolic space, of the right volume so that the dihedral angles
are all 120 degrees.  It looks like it should fill hyperbolic space
(with two hexagons and one pentagon meeting at each edge).
Is this right?

(I've just been looking at Sascha Rogmann's page
http://www-public.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de/~rogmann/hyperbolic.html
which includes some stuff on hyperbolic buckyballs
but it looks from his pictures like he's using 90 degree instead
of 120 degree dihedrals.)

    Hm, wild guess: ANY archimedean polyhedra should do. 

Regular tetrahedra do not, unless you allow cusps (vertices at infinity).
The tetrahedron has too small a solid angle to fill the hyperbolic space
around a point (with a symmetric vertex neighborhood).

I haven't thought about the others in detail, but
I'm also not convinced about snub cubes and snub dodecahedra.
Maybe the rest are ok.
You'd have to be careful how you glue them together
(e.g. for the buckyball you have to give the hexagon faces a 1/6 twist
before gluing so that you don't get two pentagons on the same edge).

By the way, there was a minor detail wrong in my post --
buckyballs don't have one dihedral, they have two, one (x) between
pairs of hexagons and one (y) between hexagons and pentagons.
The volume one wants is the one for which x+2y=360.

I suppose you are talking about a proper archimedean buckyball, which
means that all the faces are regular pentagons or hexagons,
respectively?

I don't think it's possible in hyperbolic space that all the dihedral
angles are 120 degrees, but what you really need is just that the sum of
twice the pentagon-hexagon angle plus the hexagon-hexagon angle is 360
degrees, which should be perfectly possible. Then, indeed, such a
buckyball would fill hyperbolic space.

Can you do this? The symmetry group does not act transitively on the
edges; for the snub cube (a major benefactor of Caltech--see
http://www.caltech.edu/map/images/beck_inst.gif) and snub dodecahedron
there are 3 types of edges. I think you would actually want to get a
linear combination of the two to be 360 degrees, and within that locus fix
the edge lengths.

There was a recent question about tiling hyperbolic 3-space with soccer-ball 
solids, (truncated icosahedra). And whether all Archimedeans could do the same.

Here's a rather simpler question.

Is it possible to tile the hyperbolic plane with squares, all meeting 5 at
a vertex?  
(Or similarly, any regular congruent polygons with constant excessive valence?)

It would seem so, if my memory of Escher-like patterns is anything to rely on.
There's certainly no combinatorial objection; so it's just a matter of
whether hyperbolic geometry allows it; i.e. allows them all to be squares.

So my question really is: 
     is it "easy" to prove it possible, using synthetic hyperbolic geometry?

I guess yes, but I'm no expert at handling such proofs.

I just discovered your web page and spent a bit of time thinking about
the hyperbolic buckyball tessellation.  I apologize if the following
is know to you (and the others) -- in which case, please ignore it.

I think the tessellation that you describe exists -- with 2 hexagons
and one pentagon meeting along each edge.  (In the following, I assume
that the truncated icosahedron is "regular" -- i.e. the faces are 
regular pentagons and hexagons -- and use that term instead of
buckyball, which may be less regular.)

In general, there seem to be a couple of considerations for the
existence of a tiling by a polyhedron: 1) topological or combinatorial
-- can the tiling be extended in a consistent manner, and 2) "metric"
-- does there exist a polyhedron with the right dihedral angles, edge
lengths, etc.  

In a highly symmetric tiling (with large symmetry group), which I
think is what you are proposing, the combinatorial constraints can be
checked locally.  In particular, 4 truncated icosahedra can be placed
(combinatorially) around a vertex in a consistent way with 2 hexagons
and a pentagon around each edge -- the vertex figure is a non-regular
tetrahedron with 2 "skew" (non-meeting) edges corresponding to
pentagons and 4 longer "hexagon" edges.  So there seems to be no
combinatorial problem.

The other consideration is: is there an edge length for which the
dihedral angles add up to 360 degrees (the edge length determines all
the other geometry of a "regular" hyperbolic truncated icosahedron)?
I would make the usual continuity argument for the existence of the
proper edge length: for very small edge lengths, things are almost
Euclidean and the 3 dihedral angles add up to more than 360 degrees;
the dihedral angles decrease continuously with increasing edge length
(which can increase to infinity for an asymptotic truncated 
icosahedron).  However, the dihedral angles don't decrease to 0.
So the question is: does the dihedral angle sum decrease to less than
360 degrees?  If so, the Intermediate Value Theorem says that there
is an edge length for which the dihedral angle sum is exactly 360
degrees.  I think the answer to the question is "yes".  The hexagon-
hexagon dihedral angle is larger than the hexagon-pentagon dihedral
angle in the Euclidean limit (of small edge length) and I think that
this always remains true as the edge length is increased (this is the
shaky part of the argument).  But there is a finite edge length at
which the hexagon-hexagon dihedral angle is 120 degrees -- simply
truncate an icosahedron of the regular tessellation of hyperbolic
space by icosahedra meeting 12 at a vertex.  For this edge length,
the dihedral angle sum is less than 360 degrees.

[ As Dunham later points out, the hexagon-pentagon dihedral is actually
the larger of the two, so this argument doesn't quite work -- DE ]

There may be other symmetric tessellations with more truncated
icosahedra around the edges (and more complex vertex figures).
And there may also be non-period space-filling arrangements --
like the Penrose tilings.  Other Archimedean solids may also
("regularly") tile hyperbolic space (or Euclidean 3-space or the
3-sphere).

I looked at Sascha Rogmann's buckyball tessellation.  It appears
to me to be as follows (but I may be misunderstanding it): there
are planes of pentagons and planes of hexagons.  At each vertex
there is one pentagon plane and two hexagon planes -- all mutually
perpendicular.  So all dihedral angles are 90 degrees, in each
polygon plane 4 polygons meet at a vertex, and the vertex figure
is an octahedron (but non-regular).  The tiling of the pentagon
planes is regular, but the tiling of the hexagon planes is not
regular -- the hexagon edges in pentagons planes are shorter
than the hexagon edges perpendicular to the pentagon planes.
The hexagon tiling could not be by regular hexagons, since two
different regular tilings with the same vertex valence have 
different edge lengths.  Thus the buckyballs are not "regular"
truncated icosahedra.

PS: Here is the answer to Bill Taylor's question: for any
positive integers p and q with (p - 2)*(q - 2) > 4, there is
a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by regular p-gons meeting
q at a vertex (i.e. q is the vertex valence).  The edge length
is  2*b  where  cosh(b) = cos(PI/q) / sin(PI/p)
So for fixed q, edge length increases with p (the fact used
in the previous paragraph -- where q was 4 and p was 5 or 6).

Thanks for the interesting message.  I agree with you re the
combinatorial and metric/dihedral considerations -- which is why I
suggested the tiling in the first place.  Your argument about the
truncation of the icosohedron tiling giving a lower bound on dihedrals
seems to come close to completing the picture.

One thing I'm not sure about:

    The hexagon- hexagon dihedral angle is larger than the hexagon-pentagon
    dihedral angle in the Euclidean limit (of small edge length) and I think
    that this always remains true as the edge length is increased (this is
    the shaky part of the argument).

Is this true for truncated ideal icosohedra?  I think the hex-hex
dihedral is 2pi/5.  I'm having a hard time visualizing the hex-pent
dihedrals but I'm wondering if they may be greater than pi/2, since they
would equal pi/2 in the limit of no truncation and seem to decrease
towards that limit.

[ As I point out in the next message, this part is wrong -- the hex-hex
dihedrals are 3pi/5 -- DE ]

I think the same argument about only needing to test local combinatorial
and metric considerations means one doesn't have to worry about the
solid angles at the vertices.  But...I'd be more comfortable if I could
e.g. get SnapPea to find a hyperbolic manifold with the right
fundamental domain.

In re-thinking the argument I made, I have decided that I got it backward --
namely, the pent-hex dihedrals are larger than the hex-hex dihedrals --
so my previous argument won't work.  However, I think that your observation
below closes the gap.

This seems to give us what we need -- a sum of 2 pent-hex and one hex-hex
dihedral angles, which is just what we are trying to calculate.  This sum
starts out to be more than 2 pi (at small edge length) and then decreases to
pi as the edge length goes to infinity (so for some intermediate edge length,
the sum is exactly 2 pi).

Incidentally, out of curiosity, I borrowed a paper model of a truncated
icosahedron (somewhat the worse for wear) and made very crude measurements
with a protractor of the dihedral angles.  What I found was that the pent-hex
angle was about 147 degrees and the hex-hex angle was about 135 degrees (so 
the dihedral angle sum starts out in the Euclidean limit to be about 430 degrees).

I think the same argument can be used to show that the truncated dodecahedron
can also tile hyperbolic space.  The dihedral angles of the truncated tetrahedron
and truncated cube are too small to tile hyperbolic (or Euclidean) space in this
way (with a tetrahedral vertex figure -- but there may be other ways with more
complex vertex figures); however I would guess that they do tile the 3-sphere
in this way.  I also think the truncated octahedron tiles Euclidean 3-space in
this way (in fact I can even visualize it by looking at a model) -- I think that
this is well known.

Right.  More generally, this is an example of a permutahedron
[= convex hull of permutations of the vector (0,1,2,...,d);
note that this satisfies the equation sum(v_i)=const so it is d-dimensional
rather than (d+1)-dimensional] and these are apparently known to tesselate
Euclidean space in any dimension (I think the crystallographers call it
the hyperbolic lattice, not to be confused with hyperbolic space --

truncated cuboctahedron).

Subject:        SEC: UNCLASSIFIED:-Do Buckyballs tile Hyperbolic Space.

I notice on the Geometric Junkyard page, a discussion on whether Buckyballs
(truncated icosahedra) and other Archimedean polyhedra tile hyperbolic space.

Here's my answer.

One can truncate the regular honeycombs to yield a figure consisting entirely of
truncated polytopes, a truncated {p, q} is a cell of a certian truncation of {q,
p, q}.  Thus we find a figure with truncated tetrahedra and truncated cubes in
normal 4D, in {3,3,3} and {3,4,3}, truncated octahedra tesselate 3-space,
derived from {4,3,4}, and truncated dodecahedra and icosahedra from {3,5,3} and
{5,3,5}.

In the case of the rhombotruncated icosahedron and rt cuboctahedron, there are
symmetry groups whose fundemental regions recriprocate into tilings of these
figures.

One can also get the truncated polytopes to tile using laminahedra, which are
polytopes bounded by unbounded planes.  For example, in 2D, a laminahedra is a
strip.  One can fill the strip with anything, eg triangles or squares, without
changing the surface of the strip (division into equal segments).  If one wants
to make a uniform lattice, one can stack these strips up in any way that
preserves uniform verticies: either all squares, all triangles, or alternating
square and triangle strips.

In three dimensions, the same thing can be done with plane slabs.  The sides of
these slabs are inscribed with the verticies of any of the two-dimensional
uniform lattices.  We can join different slabs together, as long as they have
the same markings on the side: the most common case is the triangles.  Here,
there are triangular prisms, and slabs of oct-tet trusses.  These can be arrayed
in different ways, eg alternating slabs of prisms and oct-tet trusses.  Since
the oct-tet truss exists in every dimension as a slab-lattice, one can create
alternating lattices in any dimension.

In hyperbolic space, one can not place two flat surfaces to run equidistant from
each other, but one can still construct figures bounded by unbounded planes.  In
hyperbolic space, a surface that is equidistant from a flat plane is a curve.
If one puts poles up on the plane, the tops of the poles are further than the
base of them.  Let us suppose that a plane is inscribed with an {8, 3}, and we
erect poles on its.  If the poles are high enough, the octagon that span the
tops of this is the same as that from an {8, 4}.  The resultant figure is a
right-angled {8, 3}.   If we keep the flat surface on the back, we get a
slab-like figure, with a rough surface on one side and a flat one on the other,
the two never crossing or meeting.

We can now take our right-angled {8, 3}, and place eight of these at each
corner, to yield an {8, 3, 4}.  This joins all of the rough sides of the slab
figures, and we're left with a figure bounded by unbounded flat {8,3}'s, and
detail completey inside, representing the verticies, edges and planes of a
{8,3,4}.

If now new faces were to start expandinging from the verticies of the {8, 3, 4},
they would eventually fill up the space within the laminae, and assume the shape
of a truncated cube.  The octagonal faces of this are internal to the
laminahdra, and the triangular faces appear on the flat surfaces, to make the
faces inscribed with the dual {3, 8}.   Using the flat surfaces as mirrors, we
fill all space with truncated cubes.

Of course, we can use any hyperbolic lattice {p,q} and any elliptic polyhedron
{q,r} in the same way, this means that from, for example, a {120, 5, 3}, we find
a figure bounded by laminahedra bounded by flat {5, 120}, the interior being
buckyballs that share their hexagonal face with another internal buckyball, and
expose the pentagonal face to the pentagonal surface.

In the case of laminahedra bounded by {p, 3}, the {p,3} are the same size
regardless of how it comes (this is because angle-angle-angle is a congurance in
hyperbolic geometry), and so it is possible to tile space with alternate
laminahedra inscribed with, say {8, 3, 3} and {8, 3, 5}, yielding a honeycomb
made of truncated tetrahedra and truncated icosahedra, eight of each to a
vertix.

Of the cuboctahedron, the icosadodecahedron and rhombi-icosadodecahedron, the
vertix figure of these are reptangles where the opposite sides are of the same
nature, different to the other pair.  If the vertix figure closes, it would be
made of made entirely of quadralaterals (eg cube, rhombic dodecahedron).
Consider a line that joins the opposite sides of these quadralaterals.  Since
they have no means to end or to cross themselves, the tiling must be done in
such a way that these lines are unbounded (either circles or open lines) and
non-crossing.  One possible tiling is a solution topologically equal to a {4,
2p}.  With p=1, we get a solution where the polyhedra are stuck back to back.
With the case of p=2, the figure honeycomb is hyperbolic, but the verticies
reside at infinity.  When p>2, the lines run perpendicular to a plane, and
thence we can pass infinite planes through this.  This cuts off the corners of
the figure, and replaces these by a quadralateral.  This rhombitruncates the
icosadodecahedra and cuboctahedra, but he rbombi-icosahedra does not become
anything uniform.

Of the rhombicuboctahedron, the vertix figure is a reptangle, with three sides
becominging squares, and the fourth a triangle.  We can 'mark' three edges of
the cube with a '3' so that each face has just one marked side.   Rhombic
Dodecahedra and tricontahedra might also be so done.  Whether these yield
figures is open.

The snub cube and dodecahedron have pentagonal corners, and so a dodecahedron is
the the likely vertix figure.  One marks six of the sides with a 4 or 5,
representing the six sides that become squares or pentagons.  There is more than
one way to do this, for example, the edges containing the inscribed octahedron,
or the six edges that are parallel to the equator when the poles are at the
verticies.  In the case of the snub tetrahedron, this yields the {3,5,3}.  It
may be possible, but the thing would be relatively large.

In conclusion.  We find the truncated and rhombitruncated polyhedra (2 p | q and
(2 p q |) in many different forms, the semiregular ones (2 | 3 4), (2| 3 5) and
(3 5|2) have none, and the snub figurus (|2 3 q) and the (3 4|2) may have one or
so.

Sphere Packing and Kissing Numbers

Problems of arranging balls densely arise in many
situations, particularly in coding theory (the balls are formed by the
sets of inputs that the error-correction would map into a single
codeword).

The most important question in this area is Kepler's problem:
what is the most dense packing of spheres in space?
The answer is obvious to anyone who has seen grapefruit stacked in a
grocery store, but a proof remains elusive.
(It is known, however, that the usual grapefruit packing is
the densest packing in which the sphere centers form a
lattice.)

The colorfully named "kissing number problem" refers
to the local density of packings: how many balls can touch another ball?
This can itself be viewed as a version of Kepler's problem
for spherical rather than Euclidean geometry.

Subject:        Polymino inclusion problem

Hello.

Problem: given a finite family of polyminoes (of any sizes), is the set
of the polyminoes that do NOT contain any member of the family finite
or infinite?

NB:
- polyminoes are those geomatrical figures obtained by sticking some
  squares together along their sides (so as to come up with a connex
  result);
- a polymino A is said to contain a polymino B if one can cover an
  instance of B with an instance of A; in other words, one can get a 'B'
  by chopping off some squares from a 'A'.

My question is: what is the status of the above problem? That is, is there
any general solution to it? If not, is the problem [known to be]
undecidable? If yes, what is its complexity?

The problem was suggested by "Winning Ways" (Berlekamp, Conway & Guy),
volume 2, page 684 -they exhibit a finite family of polyminoes that
are distinguished by the fact that they do not contain any member of 
another finite family of poliminoes.

All I have found out so far is the pretty obvious fact that the set of
the polyminoes which do not contain any instance of the "target" family
is finite if and only if there is a generation of polyminoes (all the
polyminoes of a given size) such that every member of the generation
contains at least one member of the family. All subsequent generations
share, of course, the same property. The problem can then be restated
in terms of finding the order of a "critic" generation, given a target
family (one would have "only" to test every member of the critic generation
- does it contain any member of the target family? that question is NOT
difficult - so as to decide whether the non-containing set is finite or
not.

Notice that the reverse problem is quite entertaining too: given a finite
family of poliminoes, is there any other finite family such that the first
one is the family of all those that do not contain any member of the
second one?

Have fun! All suggestions, clues, hints, remarks, references & solutions
are welcome.

finitely or infinitely many of them?). We did not come up
with any definite solution, but there were some very interesting

You won't find a clear statement of that problem in _Winning Ways_,
it is just hinted at there. I don't know of any other reference, but
such a simple problem must have been posed in some book or article

I first thought his second algorithm was transposable to polyominoes:

It looks to me like your tree algorithm for strings works just fine
when applied to snakes, resorting to some string representation of
them - the one you introduced, or more simply we can denote the moves 
by E, N, W, S and the nodes by *. When examining whether a snake (A)
contains another one (B), we have to take into account several
representations of B - depending on the geometrical transformations
that map a snake onto an equivalent one (we may retain translations
and/or rotations and/or reflexions), and for each position there are
two descriptions, one starting at each end of the snake. The same
transformations should be considered while developping the snake
tree :) Anyway, these are only details which are easily managed, my
point is that the key idea of the algorithm remains valid; in short:
developping the tree until it can't be developped any more - it is
finite - OR we run accross some node w such that w=vquq and vq is an
ancestor of w and the length of q is the same as that of the longest
snake in the family. Therefore we're left with yet another complexity
problem.

What do you think?

I answered:

I think we are left with two main problems:

1)  Designing an algorithm to find out whether, given a polymino P, a node n on P, and a snake S, we can attach a infinite series of instances of S to n which has got n as only intersection with P;

2) Proving that, if there are infinitely many polyminos avoiding the target set, then there are two snakes V and Q such that the polyminos {V, VQ, VQQ...} are indeed snakes avoiding the target family.

Given an excluding snake W ending with the same last n moves as one of its ancestor V (W=VQ), we could check whether {VQ, VQQ, VQQQ...}, is a set of snakes, thanks to 1);
2) would garantee that we would eventually stumble against a proper (V, Q) pair whenever the avoiding set would be infinite.

Now, 1) looks pretty easy : 
a) check whether {S, SS, SSS...} are valid snakes : they are iff SS is a snake;
b) (if a) holds) consider PS, PSS, PSSS... until you obtained a intersection OR the [city block] distance of each node of the (n+1)th instance to each node of P is bigger than that of its counterpart in the nth instance to the same node of P (I hope that makes sense :) .

But 2) is just a personal guess... Maybe an infinite excluding set can have some sort of an odd "spiral" structure ?

That's all folks! I know it's been a bit lengthy, but if You have found
it inspiring anyway, don't hesitate to send me your suggestions.

This is a complicated problem.

>I am really only interested in the two-dimensional case at present.

Ah!  That changes everything.  The Voronoi cell is going to be a
hexagon in the general case and a parellelogram in special cases.  If
your lattice is just ordinary Z^2 and distance is given by a quadratic
form, i.e. a 2 x 2 symmetric, positive definite real matrix, the
following algorithm outputs the four or six Voronoi neighbors of the
origin, after doing a series of changes of basis.  It is then a matter
of simple linear algebra to find equations for the six sides.

Let Q = (a b) be your quadratic form, and let P = (1 -1) and N = (1  0)
        (b c)                                     (0  1)         (0 -1)

be matrices that will be used for change of basis.  Recall that Q is
positive definite iff a,c, and the determinant, ac-b^2 are positive.
The determinant will not change throughout the computation.

The algorithm
-------------
In each step of the algorithm, update a,b, and c as necessary to
reflect changes in Q.

1. If b<0, replace Q <-- N Q N.
2. While a<b, replace Q <-- P^T Q P.
3. While c<b, replace Q <-- P Q P^T.
4. If Q changed in step 2 or 3, go back to step 2.
5. (+-1,0) and (0,+-1) are Voronoi neighbors, and so are (1,-1) and (-1,1)
provided that b > 0.

Geometric interpretation of the algorithm
-----------------------------------------
The set of positive def. quadratic forms with a given determinant,
say determinant 1, (equivalently the set of ellipses centered at the
origin with area pi) is a hyperbolic plane.  The set for which the
Voronoi cells of the lattice Z^2 are parallelograms is a collection
of geodesics that divide the hyperbolic plane into a tiling by
ideal triangles.  You can find a continuous path from any quadratic
form to any other in the same ideal triangle without degeneration
of the sides of the Voronoi region, which means that the origin has
the same Voronoi neighbors for all quadratic forms in the same triangle.

The goal of the algorithm is to find which ideal triangle contains a
given quadratic form.  Each ideal triangle divides the hyperbolic plane
into three complementary regions.  Therefore the adjacency graph of the
triangles is an infinite tree in which every vertex has three
neighbors.  The algorithm is a binary search using the fact that the
equation b = 0 determines an edge in the triangle tiling, and the fact
that an integral change of basis induces an isometry of the tiling.
Step 1 reflects the hyperbolic plane if the quadratic form Q is on the
wrong side of the geodesic b=0.  Step 2 checks if Q lies in one of the
triangles which is a left descendant of the "root" triangle T adjacent
to b=0, while step 3 does the same for the right descendants.  By the
time you get to step 4, Q lies in T itself.

Possible acceleration of the algorithm
--------------------------------------
In step 2, for example, you replace Q by P^T Q P repeatedly by a < b.
This has the effect of replacing b by b-a; a does not change.  You know
ahead of time that you are going to do this n = floor(b/a) times.  So
you can replace Q by (P^n)^T Q P^n and move to step 3.  P^n = (1 -n)
                                                              (0  1)

Does anybody know of any good algorithms to cluster nearby points to
minimize the moving of a window over those points?  In case that wasn't
clear, suppose I have a set of points randomly scattered over the plane,
and a rectangular window of some fixed size, and I want to get each point
visible inside the window at least once.  I move the window some number of
times, and that number will of course be between 0 (if all the points fit in
one view) and the number of points (if they're all far apart).  Moving the
window is expensive, so what I want is an algorithm to determine the smallest
set of window positions that covers all the points.  The algorithm should
probably be quadratic in the number of points or better - optimality is
less important.  Algorithms, references and reductions to similar problems
are all welcome...

game "xconq", where the points are playing pieces and the window is an
X window, so a good algorithm will likely show up in the next release!)

Acute Square Triangulation
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Acute Square Triangulation

An
old puzzle asks for a partition of the square into
triangles in which all angles are strictly acute.
This can be solved with eight triangles:





The dashed circles above represent "forbidden regions" in which one
of the angles would be obtuse.  As Lindgren
and Cassidy and Lord showed, eight
triangles is best possible, and there exist alternate solutions with any
even number of triangles larger than eight.

Recently, John Tromp added a new twist to the problem by asking on sci.math how to make the angles as acute as possible.
For the eight-triangle solution, he found a placement of the vertices in
which the maximum angle is only about 85 degrees, and asked if more
triangles would achieve even better angles.

My own involvement with the problem began several years earlier, with
my paper "Provably good mesh generation".
One of the ideas in that paper was to define certain "tiles" that could
be placed on the squares of a
quadtree, to form
acute-angled triangulations.


    


The dashed lines mark the boundaries of the quadtree squares, and
indicate that certain half-tiles can be recombined to form three more
tiles, including one in which a square is divided into 26 triangles, all
having angles of at most 80 degrees.  A larger image of the same square
tile is shown below.  The example triangulation above (which has now
become a standard test input in the sparse matrix algorithm community)
uses all nine tile types, and also includes several other triangulated
squares with larger numbers of triangles.





Later, I and others showed that
any polygon could be triangulated with
non-obtuse triangles, and that in fact only O(n) non-obtuse triangles suffice to
triangulate an n-sided polygon.  However some polygons might
require right angles or angles very close to 90 degrees.

Returning to Tromp's question on achieving better angles,
a result of Gerver implied that the square could
be partitioned into 72-degree triangles, not necessarily meeting
edge-to-edge.  Could this 72-degree bound be achieved by a triangulation
in which all triangles met edge to edge?
One can't do better than 72 degrees
because (by some manipulations with
Euler's formula) any triangulated
square has (1) a vertex along a square edge where only two triangles
meet, (2) a square corner covered by only one triangle, or (3) an
interior vertex where at most five triangles meet.  Cases (1) and (2)
give at best 90 degrees, and case (3) gives at best 72.





My first solution involved partitioning the square into three
rectangles, each triangulated with 20 triangles, for a total of 60
triangles.  The ends of each rectangle are covered with one 54-54-72
triangle and two 36-72-72 triangles, and the middle is filled with
smaller triangles of varying shapes.  There is some "stretch" possible
in the middle of the triangulation, so a similar solution can be used to
find 72-degree triangulations of any rectangle.

However, this is not best!  A fourteen triangle solution is possible.





To construct this triangulation, place as guides two congruent regular
pentagons, meeting at a face, diagonally in the square (as large as
possible, so that four of their corners touch the square's sides).  Use
as triangulation vertices these four points on the square's sides, the
two centers of the pentagons (on one diagonal of the square), and the
two points on the other diagonal where the pentagons share a corner.
The triangulation has six 54-54-72 triangles (connecting each pentagon
center to three pentagon edges), and eight 45-63-72 triangles (two at
each corner of the square).

Is fourteen the minimum number of triangles in a 72-degree
triangulation of the square?

Subject:        Unfolding Polyhedra
Date:           18 Feb 87 18:18:07 GMT
Organization:   Johns Hopkins Univ. Computing Ctr.

The problem of unfolding convex polyhedra, besides being part of
my thesis, has been open for many years. It was posed originally by 
G. C. Shephard, University of East Anglia, England.  A precise 
statement is:

Is it true that every convex 3-polytope has a simple unfolding?
An unfolding is produced by cutting a collection of the edges of a
polytope, imagining the polytope as a cardboard model, and flattening
the faces on a plane.  An unfolding is simple if there is no overlap,
i.e. the resulting shape on the plane is a simple polygon.

It is conjectured that the answer is "yes".  My advisor (Joseph O'Rourke) 
and I have proved the existence of simple unfoldings for
a few very restricted cases.

Observation: The collection of cut edges must form a spanning tree 
of the 1-skeleton.

Spanning Star Lemma:  If the 1-skeleton contains a spanning
star, i.e. one vertex is adjacent to all the others, then the unfolding
using the spanning star as the cut tree is always simple.

Hamiltonian Path Lemma:  If there is a Hamiltonian path spanning
the 1-skeleton such that all interior vertices of this path have an
exterior angle > pi when flattened, then the unfolding is simple.

We have an infinite class of polytopes for which some spanning trees
yield non-simple unfoldings.

We have also tried to find a polyhedron that cannot be unfolded.  It's
not hard if you allow non-convex faces (as in Karl Heuer's example) 
but surprisingly difficult for convex faces only.  Even a cube with 
nine spikes on each face turns out to have a simple unfolding.

A few related books that people might find interesting:

Cundy and Rollett, _Mathematical_Models_
Wenninger, _Polyhedral_Models_
Grunbaum and Shephard, _Tilings_and_Patterns_

It's a very interesting and difficult problem.  Any information or
references on it would be much appreciated!  Please respond to
schevon@hopkins and/or orourke@hopkins on Arpanet.

I need to be able to flatten/unwrap a 3D object.  That is, given a
relatively simple object (maybe 30 polys or so), I need to generate a 2D
image containing outlines of all of the polys laid out next to each other
(as much as possible).  If there is existing documentation on the algorithm,
please point me in the right direction.  If there is existing code for
the algorithm, please point me toward it or send it to me.

Thanks!

As Joe O'Rourke will probably also tell you, it is open whether it
is always possible to do this (unfold the faces of a convex polyhedron into
a contiguous polygon on the plane).  If your object is non-convex it is
not always possible, but I don't recall seeing any discussion of the
problem's computational complexity in that case (I wouldn't be surprised
if it's NP-complete).

Here is my entry on the subject from "The Geometry Junkyard"

See if you can get your hands on Fukuda's beautiful code for actually
performing the unfolding (despite the openeness of whether it is
always possible).

Subject:        Polygons as projections of polytopes

The recent thread on "how to pixelize a sphere" (and related short tour of
polytopes) made me think of a question I posted on sci.math a couple of 
years ago but remained unnoticed at worst and unanswered at best:

Is every convex polygon the projection of a polytope in such a way that
the polytope's vertices become the polygon's vertices and intersections of
diagonals, the polytope's edges become the polygon's edges and "diagonal
segments", and the polytope's faces become the polygon's "between-the-
diagonals" regions (save for the polytope's "base" that is the whole
polygon)?
 
For example, "lifting" the intersection point of a quadrilateral's two
diagonals vertically and "dragging" the diagonals along, we do get the
desired polytope (a pyramid); likewise, a "lifted diagonals' pentagon"
helps us solve the problem for n = 5, but it should by now be clear that
it is hard to generate the desired polytope for large n preserving both
the sought polytope's planarity of faces and the polygon's linearity of
diagonals (after projection). 

I arrived at this question when I became aware of a slick way of counting a 
polygon's "between-the-diagonals" regions using "Euler's polytope formula", 
r = e-v+2. [See for example Alan Tucker's "Applied Combinatorics" (2nd ed), 
p.184]

 . . .

it is listed as "new" on the Junkyard, but it seems over a year old.  If you
haven't already found a solution, here is mine, firstly inductively,
then non-inductively.

Suppose you have, for an existing polygonal region P, a function
f giving the height at each point, being equal to 0 on dP, the
boundary of P and continuous and affine on the polygonal
subregions in question.  Add another vertex v, making a polygon Q.

Define g on Q to be that whose graph is a pyramid with
base Q and apex v.
[e.g. if x in Q\{V}, there is a unique lambda in [0,1] and
y in (dP intersect dQ) such that x=(lambda)v+(1-lambda)y.
Define g(x)=lambda.]
Then g+f is as required except on Q\P.

But this is easy to fix, as the diagonals passing through
Q\P divide it into triangles with a vertex at v.
[e.g. define h to have graph equal to the top surface of
the convex hull of graph( (g+f)|P ) union Q x {0} ,
OR define it as some lambda in a convex combination, as above]

Come to think of it, this construction can be done
in closed form.  Read a_b as a-subscript-b here:

Let P be the polygon and V the finite vertex set.
For each v in V, define g_v on P by
  g_v(x) = min{ lambda : exists y in P
                        such that x=lambda v + (1-lambda) y }
and define g = ( sum_v g_v ) - 1 .

Cheers, Andrew

Does anyone know whether the Penrose tiling is 3-colorable?

Note: This question makes sense because a graph is 3-colorable iff
every finite subgraph is 3-colorable, and any two Penrose tilings
have the same finite subgraphs.

When playing with some colored Penrose tiles, I never got stuck when
using only three colors (until I ran out of tiles of those colors!),
but no criteria that I could find that imply three colorabilty
seem to apply to the Penrose tiling.
I also couldn't come up with a general method to 3-color the dilation of
a three colored (finite) tiling.

Date:           15 Aug 1995 22:18:33 GMT
Organization:   NAS - NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA

Let H denote the Hilbert space of square-summable sequences of reals.

QUESTION:  What is the "right" definition of a regular polytope in H, and what 
is the classification of such things?

Consider a bounded set S of points of H having no limit point in H.
Then if the convex hull C(S) of S is to be called a regular polytope, I should
think that it ought to satisfy, at minimum, the following condiitions:

   1.	C(S) is contained in no codimension-one affine subspace of H.
   
   2.	Let a "flag" be a sequence  F = (F_0, F_1, F_2,...) of faces of C(S), 
   where F_0 is a face of C(S) (codimension-one in H), and F_(k+1) is a 
   codimension-one face of F_k for each k = 1,2,....   Then for any two such 
   flags F' and F'', there exists an isometry of H carrying F' into F''.

Two examples of such C(S) are the following:

   a)	The convex hull of the set {e_i, -e_i : i = 1,2,...}, where e_i is
   the ith standard  basis vector in H (1 in the ith place and 0 otherwise).
   (This seems analogous to the octahedron or "cross-polytope".)
   
   b)	Let D = the convex hull of the set {e_i : 1 = 1,2,...}.  This lies in
   the codimension-one affine subspace L = {(c_1,c_2,...) : sum c_i = 1}.  Now
   let I: L -> H be an isometry of L onto H.  Then I(D) satisfies 1. and 2. 
   above.  (This seems analogous to the tetrahedron or simplex.)

(But there seems to be no analogue of the cube, since (1,1,...) is not in H.)

QUESTION:  Is there any example satisfying 1. and 2. that is essentially 
distinct from a) and b) ???

References to any literature on this subject would also be appreciated.

Heesch's Problem
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Heesch's Problem

The Heesch number of a shape in the plane is the maximum
number of times that shape can be completely surrounded by copies
of itself. What possible values can this number take? 

More formally, if one has a tiling of the plane (a
collection of disjoint connected open sets the closures of which cover the
plane), the first corona of a tile is the set of all tiles
that have a common boundary point with the tile, including the
original tile itself. The second corona is the set of tiles
that share a point with something in the first corona, and so on.
The Heesch number of a shape is the maximum value of k for
which all tiles in the kth corona of any tiling are
congruent to that shape.

The Heesch number of a triangle, quadrilateral, regular hexagon,
or any other shape that can tile the plane, is infinity.
Conversely, an argument based on the axiom of choice shows that a
shape with infinite Heesch number must tile the plane. But the
Heesch number of a circle is zero, because it can't even be
surrounded once by copies of itself without leaving some uncovered
space.

Heesch's problem is to determine the largest possible finite
Heesch number, or more generally what values other than zero and
infinity can occur as the Heesch numbers. For a long time the
record holder was a shape found by Robert Ammann, consisting of a
regular hexagon with small projections on two sides and matching
indentations on three sides. It was believed that
this shape had Heesch number three, until in April 2000
Alex Day pointed
out that the actual number is four (perhaps this simply reflects
a disagreement on the definition of a tiling, since his tiling is not
simply connected -- the common boundary of certain pairs of tiles is
disconnected).




As can be seen in the picture above, there exist tilings in which
copies of the same
shape are used all the way out to the fourth corona. One way of
proving that this gives the Heesch number of this shape would be to
go through a case analysis showing that no fifth-corona tiling is
possible.

However a more elegant argument is possible. First note that one
can not even produce a single corona without placing the tiles
according to the standard hexagonal tiling, with indentations on
one tile matched by projections on the adjacent tile. If one could
fill the fourth corona this way, it would have 61 hexagons, 122 projections,
and 183 indentations, so there would be at least 61 unmatched
indentations on the outside boundary of the corona. However the
same fourth corona would have only 54 hexagon edges on its outside
boundary, which is not enough to hold all those unmatched
indentations. Therefore the only way to fill the fourth corona is to
match some pairs of indentations with flat sides or each other,
forming small holes that prevent the creation of a fifth corona.

If, instead, we had formed a tile with three projections and two
indentations per hexagon, the same argument would show that its Heesch
number is three.

Other shapes are known with Heesch numbers one or two (see for
instance Anne Fontaine, "An infinite number of plane figures with
Heesch number two", J. Comb. Th. A 57 (1991) 151-156). Very
recently there has been significant progress on the problem: W. R.
Marshall found a shape with Heesch number four
(formed by indenting and outdenting the union of two hexagons, prior to
Day's discovery that Heesch's tile achieves the same number), and
Casey Mann
has found a similarly indented and outdented pentahex with Heesch number
five! (Or maybe even six with the same definition as Day.)




It remains open whether any polygon has higher Heesch number,
but these new techniques seem very powerful and likely to lead to
further results. Mann writes that that "rounder" polyominoes than
the long-skinny ones he's been using may have a better chance of
giving unbounded Heesch numbers.

The Heesch number question seems closely connected to two other
famous open tiling problems: does there exist an algorithm for
determining whether a shape can tile, and does there exist a shape
that can only tile aperiodically? Aperiodic tiling seems to act as
a barrier to the existence of tiling algorithms, so it is not
expected that both of these problems have the same answer. On the
other hand, if no finite Heesch number is larger than some 
k, then it seems that this could be used as the basis of an
algorithm to test whether a shape tiles: simply attempt to fill out
a tiling to the (k+1)st corona; if successful, the shape
must tile the plane, and if not, the shape does not tile.

One can also ask similar questions about Heesch numbers for
tilings in higher dimensions, for plane groups other than
congruence, or for restricted classes of shapes, however I don't
know any answers...

see a squared square.  *The smallest square, S, in this squared square cannot 
be on the boundary.* Therefore, the cube with S for a face is surrounded by 
four larger cubes, so its opposite face abuts another squared square.  We
can now look at the smallest square in this squared square.  It is then
the face of some cube surrounded by four larger cubes, which we can look
at the opposite face of, and so on: since this process can be continued

The difference between 2D and 3D is in the starred statement.  The smallest

I thought one could always fold any triangle into a tetrahedron by making 
four congruent triangles using folds through the midpoints of the edges.  Is 
there something special about 2-3-4 that allows another solution?

Can you do it by folding only three lines about 2-3-4 triangle?

You're right, this is a good puzzle.  I had to actually try folding some 
paper in order to understand it.

The four congruent triangle "solution" (top part of attached GIF image) 
doesn't work.  It is possible to get a tetrahedron in which each of the 
original triangle edges is doubled back along its midpoint, but it takes more 
than three folds (middle of GIF).

My solution is the bottom of the GIF.  The fold points are at the middle of 
the long edge, and 1/6 and 1/3 of the way along the middle edge.

Ok, I found it.  It is an N-shape, with vertices one unit along the length-3 
side, 1.5 units along the long side, at the obtuse vertex, and 3 units along 
the long side.  (Image attached.)

I found this by systematically going through all ways of making an N shape in 
the triangle, with one vertex of the N at a triangle vertex.  One way gave my 
previous solution, four of them led to the four folds I showed you in my 
previous message (all with more than three folds), and the sixth led to this 
solution.

By the way, there are also three infinite families of tetrahedra that can be 
folded from the triangle. if you fold two of the triangle edges in half, so 
that all three vertices meet at a point, you get a shape with one remaining 
edge (forming a continuous loop) and two interior vertices at the midpoints 
of the original triangle. The other two tetrahedron vertices can be chosen to 
be any two opposite points from the loop.  There is one solution in common to 
all three such families: the one I first sent you.  However, it seems that 
none of these possibilities uses only three folds.

I have to apologize you for my mistake.
The second one is not a solution because of non-tetrahedoron.
It seems that the problem has unique solution.

I also looked like a near-flat tetrahedron at first.
Now I think that it is perfect-flat.
How are you feeling?

You are right, it is flat.
Proof:
    
    Let the triangle be ABC, with AB=2, BC=3, AC=4.
    Draw D on AC at distance 1 from A, E = midpoint(D,C), and
    F on BC at distance 2 from B.
    My proposed fold pattern was along line segments BD, BE, and EF.
    
    Then BCD is isosceles, so 2*angle(BDC)+angle(BCD)=180.
    But also angle(ADB)+angle(BDC)=180, so subtracting the two equations
    gives angle(BDC))+angle(BCD)=angle(ADB), so these three angles
    fold flat rather than making one of the corners of a tetrahedron, QED.

One can also observe that ADB is similar to ABC, BDE is isosceles,
and (since the other tetrahedron corners must also be flat) BEF is a right 
triangle. I don't know of any similar nice property for the remaining 
triangle, EFC. This construction also makes it clear that the sharp angle of 
the 2-3-4 triangle is twice that of a 1-sqrt(15)-4 right triangle, which is 
helpful if you want to calculate the angles.

     Let's see.  You can easily divide the cube into 6 congruent and

Actually, it's possible to subdivide a cube into only six congruent
disjoint tetrahedra, meeting in a common edge along the long diagonal of
the cube.  If you give up congruence, you can reduce this number to five:
just cut off every other corner of the cube, leaving a regular
tetrahedron in the middle.

This raises an interesting open question for higher dimensional
hypercubes: what is the minimum number of simplices into which they can
be cut?  The long-diagonal construction generalizes to d! simplices in d
dimensions, which can be reduced to O(d!/k^d) for some k by using
Cartesian products of the five-tetrahedron solution.  There is also a
lower bound of Omega(sqrt d! k^d) for another constant k coming from
volume arguments (What is the largest simplex you can fit into a
hypercube?  This is equivalent to asking what's the largest determinant
you can get with a 0-1 matrix, and is answered by the theory of Hadamard
matrices.)  Both bounds can be tightened slightly but there still
remains a big gap between them.  I'm not sure if it makes a difference
whether you allow additional vertices (as in your 12-tetrahedron solution)
or just stick with the original set of 2^d vertices.

Subject:        Triangulation of cubes

The n-dimensional cube, C^n, can be dissected into n! simplices.
(Proof: let the coordinates of R^n be x_1,...,x_n.  Take any
permutation P=(j_1,...,j_n) of (1,...,n) and let S_J be the set of
points in R^n with 0 <= x_{j_1} <= x_{j_2} <= ... <= x_{j_n} <=1.
The n! S_J's provide the dissection.)

However n! is not necessarily the minimum number of simplices in a
dissection of C^n.  For example, the cube in 3 space can be cut up
into 5 tetrahedrons.  (See http://www.columbia.edu/~law9023/cubes.html
for a crude illustration of this.)

So my question is: if d_n is the minimal number of simplices in a
dissection of C^n, what is known about the sequence {d_n}?  If this is
something I could have found in the Handbook of Integer Sequences, I
apologize but I don't have immediate access to that book.

You can get n!/c^n for some c>1, e.g. by using Cartesian products of the
5-tetrahedron triangulation of the 3-cube or the 16-tetrahedron
triangulation of the 4-cube.

There is a lower bound of something like sqrt(n!) based on volume
arguments (i.e. the ratio between the volume of the d-cube and the max
volume of a d-simplex with 0-1 vertex coordinates, closely related to
Hadamard matrices).  I vaguely recollect that you can slightly improve
this (again by c^n for some c>1) by using hyperbolic volume of ideal
d-cubes and ideal simplices.

As far as I know, the big gap between these upper and lower bounds has
not been narrowed.

Can you explain that a little more?  In general, the product of two
simplices is not a simplex (otherwise d_n would equal 1 for all n), so
what is the Cartesian product of a triangulation?  (And is there a
good description of the 16-tetrahedron triangulation of the 4-cube?)

A simple and relatively efficient triangulation of the $n$-cube.

An $n$-cube, $I\sp n$, is "triangulated" if it is the union of
$n$-simplices which are disjoint on interiors and whose vertices are the
vertices of $I\sp n$. The author gives an elegant way of triangulating the
cube $I\sp {kn}$ once a triangulation of $I\sp n$ is

The naive Euclidean estimate is worst when a Hadamard matrix exists, and
in 3-dimensions there is a tetrahedron with 1/3 of the volume of a cube so
the bound is 3. Regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra have volume 1/5 of the
volume of the cube, so the hyperbolic estimate is 5, which is sharp since
the regular ideal cube can be decomposed into 5 regular ideal tetrahedra.

Doug Zare answered the rest of your questions, but I think not this one.

It's pretty similar to the 5-tetrahedron triangulation of the 3-cube.
Recall that that works by cutting off every other corner of the cube;
the remaining piece in the middle turns out to be a regular tetrahedron.

So, let's try doing the same thing in four dimensions.
Cut off every other corner of a 4-cube.  The 4-cube has 16 corners,
so you cut off 8 simplices this way.

What's the shape of the piece left over in the middle?  It has 8
tetrahedral faces (where you cut off a corner of the cube), and some
more faces (subsets of the original faces of the cube you started with).
The 4-cube has 8 faces, and after you cut the corners off these faces
turn into regular tetrahedra.  So the left over piece has 16
regular-tetrahedron faces.  It's one of the six regular 4-polytopes, the
16-cell!

The 16-cell is easiest to visualize with the help of a Schlegel diagram:
form a regular tetrahedron in 3-space, and nest inside it a regular
tetrahedron in the opposite orientation (so that each vertex of the
inner tetrahedron is near the middle of a face of the outer
tetrahedron), think of the inner tetrahedron as being opaque and the
outer one as being transparent, and connect every pair of inner and
outer vertices that can see each other.  Two of the faces of the 16-cell
are the tetrahedra you started with.  Eight more are formed by
connecting a face of one tetrahedron to a vertex of the other, and the
remaining six connect an edge of one tetrahedron to an edge of the
other.

To finish the 4-cube's triangulation, just connect one of the 16-cell's
vertices with each of the opposite faces.  Each vertex is opposite 8
faces of the 16-cell (because the other 8 faces touch the vertex, as you
can see from the Schlegel diagram).  So this step forms 8 more
simplices, which added to the 8 corners you cut off give a total of 16.

It isn't so simple to extend this idea to higher dimensions.  E.g., if
you cut off every other corner of a 5-cube, you get a non-regular
polytope, with 16 4-simplex faces and 10 16-cell faces.

A short answer: the product of a triangulation is simply the set of cells
of the form (simplex in one triangulation) times (simplex in the other).
Of course, these cells are not themselves simplices, for instance the
product of a 1-simplex(=line segment) and 2-simplex(=triangle) is a
triangular prism rather than a tetrahedron.  So, you have to
further subdivide the cells to get a triangulation again.

I'm including a copy of Zare's message again for you below.

that is, not so much cube triangulation) is my own paper,

Ok, let the given pentagon be abcde.  Let the "small" pentagon of a 
pentagon P be denoted S(P).

As someone (Peter Montgomory?) noted, some two of the five points have 
the same parity, so one of the ten edges connecting pairs of vertices 
has a lattice midpoint m.

If m is in S(abcde), we are done.

Else, if m is on an interior diagonal of the pentagon,
say m = (a+c)/2, then one of the two pentagons abmde and mbcde is 
convex, say mbcde, and S(mbcde) is a subset of S(abcde).  By induction 
on number of lattice points contained in the original pentagon, S(mbcde) 
contains a lattice point, which is also a lattice point of S(abcde).

Else, suppose m is on an edge, say ab, and consider the convex pentagon 
mbcde. Now, S(mbcde) is not a subset of S(abcde), but it is a subset of 
the union of S(abcde) and the triangle T formed by lines ac, bd, and be.  
As before, by induction, S(mbcde) contains a lattice point f.  If f is 
in S(abcde), we are done.  If f is not in S(abcde), it is in T, and 
afcde is a convex pentagon such that S(afcde) is a subset of S(abcde);  
by induction a third time, S(afcde) contains a lattice point, which is 
also a lattice point in S(abcde).

This pattern does not continue forever -- for large n, there is
no configuration of n lines which gives exactly n+1 intersection points.
(I think that this is so for all n > 10, but I have no proof of
this stronger statement.)

Here is a sketch of the proof; the full proof would be rather long.

Suppose we have a configuration of n lines giving n+1 intersection
points.  What is the largest number of lines in the configuration
which are concurrent or parallel?

These two cases will come up so often that it will be easier to move
to the projective plane, where there is no distinction between them.
Of course, this has a cost; instead of just counting intersection
points, we have to count the points and then see how many can
be removed by arranging to have them lie on the "line at infinity"
when converting back to the ordinary plane.  Note the restriction
that the line at infinity cannot be one of the n lines of the
configuration.

If all n lines are concurrent, we only get 1 projective
intersection point, which may be a finite point or a point
on the line at infinity, giving 0 or 1 ordinary intersection points.
If n-1 of them meet at one point but the n'th doesn't, then we get
n-1 additional points from the n'th line, for a total of n;
this gives either n-1 or n finite points.

If the largest number of lines at a point is n-2, then the
(n-1)'th line gives n-2 additional points, of which one may be infinite,
and the n'th line also meets the first n-2 in n-2 points, of which
one may be infinite and one may lie on the (n-1)'th line,
leaving at least n-4 new finite points.  Therefore, there are at least
(n-3)+(n-4) = 2n-7 finite points, which is too many.

Similarly, if the largest number of lines at a point is n-3,
then we get at least (n-4)+(n-5)+(n-6) = 3n-15 finite
intersection points.  Continuing this downward, we see
that, as long as k is large enough that (k-1)(k-2)/2 > n+1,
we will get too many finite intersection points if there
are k lines meeting at a point.  So, in the desired configuration,
the largest number of lines through a particular point is
at most about sqrt(2n).

Next, consider the case where two different points each have
at least d lines passing through them.  One of these lines
might pass through both points, but this still leaves d-1
other lines at each point, which produce (d-1)^2 intersection
points.  Since at most one of the points on each of the
first d-1 lines can be on the line at infinity, we get
at least (d-1)(d-2) finite intersection points.  Therefore,
in the desired configuration, the point with the second-largest
number of lines through it has at most about sqrt(n) such lines.

If one considers three points which each have at least d lines
through them, then, with a substantial amount of extra work,
one can show that there must be at least 3d^2/2 - 6d + 3
finite intersection points.  (This bound isn't quite sharp,
but the leading term is.)  Therefore, in the desired configuration,
every point with at most two exceptions lies on at most D lines,
where D is about sqrt(2n/3).

Now, the n lines give n(n-1)/2 pairs of lines, and each such
pair has an intersection point (finite or infinite).  A point
at which d lines meet takes care of d(d-1)/2 of these pairs.
There are only n+1 finite intersection points, and these
can take care of about (n+1)D(D-1)/2 ~ n^2/3 pairs.
(The two possible exceptionally large intersection points
would only yield about 5n/3 additional pairs.)
How about points on the line at infinity?  The sum of the degrees
(number of lines meeting there) of these points is at
most n, because each configuration line meets the line
at infinity only once.  And we still have the bound D on the
individual degrees.  So a simple optimization argument shows
that the number of pairs with intersection point on the
line at infinity is at most about (n/D)D(D-1)/2 ~ n^(3/2)/sqrt(6).
(Again the two exceptional points only change this bound
by O(n).)  Therefore, the total number of pairs of lines
in the configuration is n^2/3 + o(n^2); since this is
less than n(n-1)/2 for large n, we have a contradiction.
This completes the sketch of proof that no configuration of
n lines gives n+1 intersection points if n is large.

Actually, the argument shows that no configuration of n lines
gives between n+1 and cn intersection points, where c tends
to 3/2 for large n.  I conjecture that, in fact, for large n,
the first attainable number of intersection points
after 0, 1, n-1, and n is 2n-6.

I've been looking at this a little bit. It is true for
n=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 while it seems as if it is impossible for 10 lines
to meet in 11 or in 12 points (but they may meet in 9,10,13,..,45
points). In general, I don't believe it is possible for n lines to
meet in n+1 points for n>10. (Which seems simple to proove by
induction if it is prooved for n=10).

I think Erdos (or somebody else with Erdos number less than two) showed that
(n(n-1)/2) - 1 is impossible.

Some more information about this problem, at least for small n, can be found in
Grunbaum's classic treatise on convex polytopes.  According to the bibliography of
Ziegler's "Lecture Notes on Polytopes", a new edition is in the works.

Another relevant source is Grunbaum's monograph "Arrangements and Spreads".

Penrose Tiles

Penrose was not the first to discover aperiodic
tilings, but his is probably the most well-known.
In its simplest form, it consists of 36- and 72-degree rhombi,
with "matching rules" forcing the rhombi to line up
against each other only in certain patterns.  It can also be formed
by tiles in the shape of "kites" and "darts" or even by deformed
chickens (see the "perplexing poultry" entry below).
Part of the interest in this tiling stems from the fact
that it has a five-fold symmetry impossible in
periodic crystals, and has been used to explain the structure of certain
"quasicrystal" substances.

Hinged Dissections of Polyominoes

Hinged Dissections of Polyominoes

It's easy to cut one
polyomino (shape formed by joining 
squares edge-to-edge) into pieces that can be rearranged into any other 
polyomino with the same number of squares: just cut on the edges between 
squares.  But what if the pieces are to be joined together into a connected 
figure by hinges?  Can we make a device by joining polygons with hinges,
so that its hinges can be turned in different ways to form any polyomino?

For tetrominoes (shapes made from four squares), we can again just cut 
on the edges between squares. If we connect four squares by three 
appropriately placed hinges, we can form all five possible 
tetrominoes:





For higher-order polyominoes, the problem seems more difficult.
For instance, it does not seem to be possible to join five squares by 
hinges and form all twelve pentominoes.  However, we can still solve the 
hinged dissection problem by cutting the polyominoes into smaller pieces.

My original solution used the following "ambivalent 
square":





The figure shows twelve hinged pieces arranged to form a square.  But 
because of the symmetric way in which the pieces are connected to each 
other, the same pieces can be folded into a square in a different way, in 
which the pieces at the top and bottom left corners of the figure have traded 
places.  A connected sequence
of 4k 
ambivalent squares forms a universal dissection that
can be folded into any k-omino.

Erich Friedman then found a much simpler universal dissection:
Just take 2k isosceles right triangles,
hinged one to the next at their acute angles.
So the straight pentomino could be made by 10 such triangles:

    +--+--+--+--+--+
    |1/|\2|3/|\4|5/|
    |/0|9\|/8|7\|/6|
    +--+--+--+--+--+

You can even join the ends to make a ring of triangles!

Erich and I now have a paper with Erik and Martin Demain,
at the 1999 Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry:
Hinged Dissections of Polyominos
and Polyforms.  In it, we describe this isosceles triangle construction,
and related constructions for hinging polyiamonds, polyhexes, polyabolos,
and similar shapes made from multiple copies of a single polygon.

Subject:        Conceptual proof that inversion sends circles to circles

A while ago, it occured to me that if you understand the Mobius group
well enough, you can prove with an absolute minimum of computation that
inversion in a circle sends circles to (generalized) circles.  Does
this argument appears in the literature?  The argument goes as
follows:

Consider the set of complex lines in C^2; it is parametrized by the
complex numbers and infinity.  The set of linear transformations on C^2
is a group action on this set; let the corresponding permutation group
of the set be G.  Since [[a,b],[c,d]] sends (1,z) to (a+bz,c+dz), it
thus sends the slope z to (c+dz)/(a+bz).  If a linear transformation
preserves the lines (z,0) and (0,z), it must be diagonal, and if it
preserves a third line also, it must be proportional to the identity.
As any pair of lines in C^2 is equivalent to any other, we conclude
that if an element of G fixed three points, it is the identity.

Extend G to G-hat by adding complex conjugation.  In G-hat, there are
two elements which fix any given triple of points.  Indeed, we can say
what the other one is:  Inversion in the (generalized) circle through
the three points.  To know this, we only need to know that all
inversions in circles are in G-hat.  Inversion in the unit circle is
simply z -> 1/z-bar, and by conjugating by elements of G we can make
inversion in any other circle.

So we now have a characterization of generalized circles:  They are the
collection of fixed sets of elements of G-hat with at least three
points.  Any element of G-hat must permute this collection.  In
particular, z -> 1/z-bar does.

Or with three ellipses, all with arbitrarily small eccentricity.

3 round circles in R^3 (or its conformal compactification S^3) with pairwise
linking number 0  bound  3 mutually disjoint hemispheres in the 4 ball
H^4 union S^3.
Each hemisphere is the compactification of a hyperbolic plane.
Consider a round 4 ball with radius R(t) increasing linearly with time and with center not lying on one of the three hyperbolic planes. Let T be the last of the times when it touches one (say N) of the three planes L. M, N. Then there is a hyperplane Q tangent to the ball B(T) at the point of tangency with  the plane 
N. There's an isotopy, within the class of totally geodesic planes which 
are disjoint from L and M,
of  the plane N within the hyperplane Q which ends at a plane P' which is is separated from L and M  by a hyperplane disjoint 
from L, M and P'. Therefore a link of 3 round circles which have linking 
numbers zero is split. (In fact by a further isotopy one can see that the link is the trivial link.) So the Borromean rings is not a link of round circles.

I heard this at MSRI in 1983. I think the argument is Freedman's. I don't 
think reflection groups have anything to do with it, though there may be a
variant argument.

(This is a generalization of a problem I posed around two years ago.)

Throughout this article, let n = 2k+1, where k is some fixed integer > 0;  

Define a k-hoop in R^n to be any geometric k-sphere of radius 1 in R^n. 

Denote the space of all k-hoops in R^n by H(k).  The space H(k) is endowed with
a natural topology (as the product of R^n and the Grassmannian G(k,n) of 
k-planes in R^n).

Define an r-hoople to be a set of r disjoint k-hoops.

Denote the space of all such r-hooples by H(k;r).  This space H(k;r) also has
a natural topology on it (from the deleted rth Cartesian power of H(k), which 
is then factored out by the symmetric group S(r)).

		*		*		*

QUESTION:  How many arcwise-connected components does H(k:r) have, and what is 
a representative r-hoople for each one?

		*		*		*

For a simple case, what is the answer for k = 2, r = 3 ???  (I don't know.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The original question considered the case k = 1, r = 3, and was answered 
empirically rather than with a proof.  The apparent answer here is that there 
are exactly 5 components, represented by the following cases:

(The word "hoop" is used here to mean a 1-hoop.  In R^3, of course.)

a) three mutually unlinked hoops,
b) two linked hoops and the third far away, 
c) a chain of three hoops, 
d) a circular chain of mutually linked hoops, and 
e) left to the reader as a puzzle.

All circular chains of three hoops seem to lie in the same component of H(1;3)
(and there is a theorem that the Borromean rings cannot be represented by
round circles).

The case k = 1, r = 4 has been studied by Stein Kulseth of Norway, who came up
with the empirical result of 33 distinct components (last I heard).

Okay, here's my secret plan to take over the world.  Don't tell anybody.

When I die, I want a scalene triangle of unspecified scalenity on my tombstone.

The Master Masons carving my monument will say "Hey!  Kibo made this
easy for us 'cause he liked us!  So we like him!  Let's give him an
extra-special monument!" and then they'll carve it out of solid diamond
using a golden chisel, the most difficult expensive combination
other than Archimedes Plutonium's proposed solid plutonium pyramid tomb.

At sunrise on solstice morning, New Agers from around the world would
come to stare at the sun through my lens-shaped diamond tombstone.
Also, all the lettering on the tombstone would be not just incised
so you could feel it, but flavored so you could taste it.

All this from a humble scalene triangle, the cheapest kind to make,
unless you're using Legos.

And speaking of scalene triangles, it bothers me that you can have a
perfectly equilateral triangle but mathematicians have not yet agreed
on the dimensions of a perfectly scalene triangle.

I was going to propose one where the sides are 1, 2, and 3 units long,
as I think that would be a pretty cool triangle, what with side B being
twice side A and side C being three times A and 50% improved over B.
Also the angle opposite C would have over ten trijillion times as many
degrees (plus some radians, too) as any of the other two angles,
which would be so sharp you wouldn't be able to see them before you
accidentally tried to pick the triangle up.

But then I realized that what makes a 1:2:3 triangle so excitingly
scalene is that two sides are much longer than one of the other sides.
Wouldn't it be even better if side C was to B as B is to A?
Therefore, let's try 1:2:4.  Success!  The triangle is so scalene
that the mind of Man cannot even conceive of it!  And carrying this
scheme to its omega we reach the pinnacle of scalenitude:

           1  :  100000000  :  10000000000000000000000000000000000

The technical term for this triangle is "the equisilly triangle"
because no one angle in it is any sillier than the whole.

I have applied for a patent on the equisilly and am awaiting the
patent office's approval and the return of my working model.

You may be thinking of Richmond's construction (1893), as reproduced
in Stewart's "Galois Theory".  The proof begins with two perpindicular
radii OA and OB in a circle centered at O.  Then locate point I on OB
such that OI is 1/4 of OB.  Then locate the point E on OA such that
angle OIE is 1/4 the angle OIA.  Then find the point F on OA
(extended) such that EIF is half of a right angle.

Let K denote the point where the circle on AF cuts OB.  Now draw a
circle centered at E through the point K, and let N3 and N5 denote
the two points where this circle strikes OA.  Then, if perpindiculars
to OA are drawn at N3 and N5 they strike the main circle (the one
centered at O through A and B) at points P3 and P5.

The points A, P3, and P5 are the zeroth, third, and fifth verticies
of a regular heptadecagon, from which the remaining verticies are
easily found (i.e., bisect angle P3 O P5 to locate P4, etc.).

Gauss's Disquisitiones gives only the algebraic expression for the
cosine of 2pi/17 in terms of nested square roots, i.e.,

  cos(2pi/17)  =  -1/16 + 1/16 sqrt(17) + 1/16 sqrt[34 - 2sqrt(17)]

 + 1/8 sqrt[17 + 3sqrt(17) - sqrt(34-2sqrt(17)) - 2sqrt(34+2sqrt(17)]

which is just the solution of three nested quadratic equations.
Interestingly, although Gauss states in the strongest terms (all caps)
that his criteria for constructibility (based on Fermat primes) is
necessary as well as sufficient, he never published a proof of the
necessity, nor has any evidence of one ever been found in his papers
(according to Buhler's biography).

I've heard that this story is apochryphal (about Gauss, not about
Archimedes), but it's apparently true that Gauss's discovery of 
the 17-gon's constructibility (which had been an open problem from
antiquity) at or before the age of 19 led to his decision to follow 
a career in mathematics rather than philology.

Is the following well-known in computational geometry ?
Let P be a finite set of co-planar points. Define a linear order on P
by ordering the points in the order they are illuminated by a light 
ray sweeping out a circle centered at some point S not in P. I assume
that the ray is incident with at most one point of P at any instant.
The problem is to maximize the minimum of the angles subtended at S
by consecutive points of P. I shall call such a point S a sighting point.
There are configurations such that such a point does not exist. Also there
may be several such points for a given set P.

Summary:        does a bifocal curve exist?

Say that a point P in the interior of a simple closed curve C in the
plane is a _focal point_ of C if C is starlike w.r.t. P and all the
chords of C passing through P have the same length.

Is it known whether a simple closed curve can have more than one
focal point?

[C is starlike w.r.t. P means every ray from P intersects C in exactly
one point; this is a condition weaker than convexity (though C is
convex iff it is starlike w.r.t. every interior point).  There are
plenty of curves with one focal point.]

Let a *wheel* be a Jordan curve W in the plane.
A chord  for W is a line segment with endpoints on W.
A point p in the plane is an *axle* for W if there
exists an L>0 such that for every w in W,
there is a w' in W such that |w-w'| = L and the segment
[w,w'] contains p in its interior.
Then a less restrictive form of Elkies' question is:

	does there exist a wheel with two axles?

Here are some recollection of my thoughts
on this problem from 1990 or so.
It can be related to dynamical systems as follows.
Let p and q be two (candidate) axles; I think one can show
they both must have the same L, by considering the line
through p and q.  Given a point w, allegedly on the wheel,
one can construct two more points w_1 and w_2 on the wheel by drawing lines
of length L from w through p and w through q.  Repeating this process,
you can make a computer drawing of (lots of) points which must
lie on the wheel W to be consistent with the data (w,p,q,L).
By starting with points w very close to the line through p and q,
you can generate continua which must lie in W.  These continua
tend to be non-locally connected, due to incoherence between
stable and unstable manifolds in this dynamical system
(a well-known phenomena).  I suspect this can be made into a proof
that there is no wheel with two axes.  It should be considerably
simpler with the assumption that the wheel is star-shaped from
p and q.  But perhaps the discussion is "academic", since a solution
of a large portion of the problem appears in:

A point P inside a closed convex curve C is called equichordal if    
every chord of C drawn through point P has the same

It proves that a curve cannot have two equichordal points. The

Hi there,

First things first, I lost every one of my email contacts when moving site so 
if you've been corresponding with me please note my new email address.

I'm trying to write a computer program to do minimal geometric dissections (in 
2D) and Stage 1 is finding all valid polyhedra with a given number of faces.

I've sorted out all with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 faces; although may have some 
self-crossing nets (doesn't make a valid polyhedron) in the 6 face nets. And 
only have edges & corners on the nets yet (working on finding the faces).

I've only got partial solutions for 7, 8 and 9 faces.

It would help a lot if someone can tell me how many different polyhedra have 7 
faces; even more if someone has a computer program that plays around with 
polyhedral (or other) nets.

By the way:
Stage 1 is finding all polyhedra with a given number of faces;
Stage 2 is adding extra nodes on edges and matching these to each given 2-D 
geometric figure;
Stage 3 is comparing nets face by face for possible correspondences and 
constructing constraint equations;
Stage 4 is finding dependencies in the constraint equations and solving them 
if possible.

most of the implications are immediate (e.g. quadrant ==> half plane,
since the half plane may be tiled with two quadrants).  the only
non-obvious implications are:     itself ==> quadrant,  and
                              bent strip ==> (quadrant &) strip.
i will leave these to the reader to prove.

if we add the "three-quarter plane" we have the implications:

          quadrant  ==>  three-quarter plane  ==>  plane

the first implication is immediate, but i need the axiom of choice
to deduce the second.  (if anyone can prove the second without the
axiom of choice, please let me and sci.math know.)  as a hint,
try to prove that if a polyomino can cover an N-by-N square for all N
(no overlap, and pieces may hang over the edges of the square), then
it tiles the plane.  i don't know if the implication 

              three-quarter plane  ==??==>  half plane 

is valid, but there are a number of potential implications that
haven't yet been ruled out, even though there's no apparent reason
they should hold.  (e.g.  itself  ==??==> rectangle)

     This is a nice question, if we interpret "simplest" as
"nicest".  Let's ask for one whose group contains the icosahedral
rotation group.  Then unless the center of a face is at one
end of an axis of symmetry, that face is one of an orbit of size 60.
If it IS, the face is one of an orbit of size  12,20, or 30,  but
we can have at most one each of these.  This gives 8 residue-classes
modulo 60, namely

   60N +  0, 12, 20, 30, 32, 42, 50, 62

for icosahedrally symmetric N-hedra - note that 100 isn't in any of these.

     If we took the rotational cube group, we'd get

   24N + 0, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 26

and again 100 isn't present.

    The rotational tetrahedral group gives

   12N + 0, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 14

and here we can get 100, but only as 12N + 4  for  N = 8.

     Here's a hecatohedron with full tetrahedral symmetry:

Form the "16-reticulated cube", by dividing each face of a
cube into 18 smaller "square" faces in the obvious way,
giving a 96-hedron.  Then tetrahedrally truncate this.

I suppose I'd call it the

     "semi-trivalently-truncated 16-reticulated cube" !

    Otherwise, the group of rotational symmetries is
cyclic or dihedral, and it follows that at most 2
faces can be fixed by a subgroup of size more than 2 (of
ANY symmetries, rotational or not).

   If the full group has order N, it must have an orbit of
size at least N/2,  whence  N/2 is at most 100, and N at most 200.

A bit of thought shows that the only two possibilities with a group
of order 200 are the pentacontagonal bipyramid and antibipyramid.

   - the 3*N*N box (3*quadrant) is tileble.

Interesting. I can think of several layers of generalization, all of
which I will answer in the charming language of "genericness" which
lets one avoid ever actually proving anything (and which, therefore,
may be wrong!). There are some meaty computational questions raised at
the end to which I hope to return in a later post.

Let's see, a generic line in  R^3  is characterized by the
point  p  where it crosses the  xy-plane and the unit vector  v  in it pointing
up (towards positive  z), giving  4  degrees of freedom. Each line determines
a unique linear function  f: R -> R^3  which parameterizes the line:
f(t) = p + t v. Two such lines intersect if there exist values  t  and  t'
with  f(t)=f'(t'), which sets  3  linear equations on the  2  unknowns  and
so in general has a unique solution iff some single equation in
a, p, a', and p'  is met. If  a'  and  p'  are given, this requires that
(a, p)  lie in an algebraic set of codimension 1 in the family of all possible
(a, p) 's. Since this family has dimension  4, as noted above, we should 
expect to be able to do this four times before we're down to a discrete set:
generically, any set of four lines has common intersection with only
finitely many different other lines. The original question claims this
finite number is  2.

In  R^n  we likewise see that the collection of lines has dimension  2n-2;
the condition that a line meets some other fixed line imposes  n  equations
on the set of variables made of all these parameters and two more (the 
t  and  t')  and so imposes  n-2  equations on the set of  (2n-2)  variables.
For large  n  we see this is generically impossible to arrange as soon as
3  such intersections are required, although we would expect finitely many
lines to intersect any three lines in  R^4  in general position. It is
not clear from this analysis what that finite number is. 

In dimensions higher than four, you can only expect to start with 2
lines, but clearly given any two lines, the possible other lines which
meet both of these are parameterized by the positions on the  two fixed
lines where the intersections are to occur, so that the collection of
all of them is precisely the 2-dimensional affine space, which is
consistent with the above dimension counts.

We could generalize a little differently by allowing the subspaces to 
have a dimension  k  different from  1. The collection of  k-dimensional
subspaces of  R^n  has dimension  N=(k+1)(n-k). Fix two of them by
specifying the  N  parameters for each. A point on each subspace is
determined by specifying  k  coordinates, so the condition that the
subspaces meet is expressed with  n  equations in  2k  unknowns, which
will not all be satisfied in general; indeed, we expect this to force
n-2k  equations on the  2N  parameters. So if we view just one of the
two subspaces as really fixed and the other as variable, then the
condition that the two meet forces  n-2k  equations to be satisfied
by the  N  varying parameters. We expect to be able to do this  m
times as long as  m(n-2k) < N; if equality holds, we expect only a
finite number of possibilities.

So it looks to me that given any generic set of  m  subspaces of dimension  k
in  R^n, you can find another such subspace which intersects all  m  of
them iff  m < (k+1)(n-k)/(n-2k). The earlier paragraphs considered the
case  k=1. (The case  k=0  is trivial: two points don't intersect unless 
equal.) For any  k, it's clear that you can usually only find an
intersecting subspace if the number of starting subspaces is at most  k+1
(any two lines can be joined, any three planes, etc.); but for each  k
you can possibly join more subspaces if the ambient dimension  n  is small
(you can join an extra subspace as long as  n < k(k+3). The number of
extra subspaces you can join goes up as  n  goes down, until you reach
n=2k; for dimensions that low or lower you can join any number of subspaces
of dimension  k; for example, you can find a line passing through any
countable collection of planes in R^3).

Finally, one could generalize by allowing the subspaces to have different
dimensions. This looks like a combinatorial nightmare, but one case is
perhaps worthwhile: to let all the fixed subspaces have the same dimension
k1  and to let the intersecting ones have a different dimension  k2.
For example, this includes the question of the number of subspaces of
dimension  k2  pass through any  k2  distinct points (k1=0); of course
the answer there is one. It's easy enough to incorporate this variation in
the preceding analysis.

The more challenging question is to determine the number of possible
intersecting subspaces when that number is finite (but nonzero). That is,
for any  k  and any factorization  k(k+1) = d1 d2, we look for the generic
number of subspaces of dimension  k  which meet each of  k+1+d1  other
subspaces of dimension  k  inside  R^(2k+d2).

k=1: How many lines pass through a generic set of  4  lines in  R^3? (Two?)
     How many lines pass through a generic set of  3  lines in  R^4?

k=2: How many planes pass through a generic set of  9  planes in  R^5?
     How many planes pass through a generic set of  6  planes in  R^6?
     How many planes pass through a generic set of  5  planes in  R^7?
     How many planes pass through a generic set of  4  planes in  R^10?

and so on. It is probably possible to answer any one of these with sufficient
calculations in algebraic geometry (I'll give it a go) but I don't
see right off the bat how to tackle all of them at once.

David Eppstein,

Your Geometry Junkyard is very interesting and informative.
Below are remarks pertaining to the four lines, and their
possible generalizations to higher dimensions, attributed 
to Jim Buddenhagen.  

I'm assuming a finite set of lines in  3-space to be
in gp (general position) provided no two of them lie in
a plane.  

I don't think that four lines in gp in 3-space always admit
a common skewer, i.e. a line which intersects all four.

For example, consider the four lines  L(i)  represented
parametrically by the four real parameters  u(i):

       L(1) :  ( u(1),     1,   -1 )         

       L(2) :  (   -1,  u(2),    1 )         

       L(3) :  (    1,    -1, u(3) )         

       L(4) :  ( u(4),  u(4), u(4) ) .

The first three lines are parallel to the coordinate axes,
intercepting the coordinate planes in  ( 0, 1,-1), (-1, 0, 1)
and  ( 1,-1, 0), respectively.  The fourth passes through the 
origin with direction ( 1, 1, 1).  None of the six pairs lies
in a plane.

According to my calculations no line intersects all four.
Grinding through the algebra yields the requirement that

                  u(4)**2 = -1/3 .

I suspect that something like the following takes place.  
If we have three lines  L(i), i=1,2,3,  in gp in 3-space, the
union of all lines  K  which intersect all  L(i)  forms a 
(quadratic?) surface. Furthermore, these lines  K  are
disjoint and form a decomposition of the surface. 

A  fourth line  L(4)  may intersect that 
surface in  zero points, one tangent point, two points or
the line  L(4)  itself.  This would imply that four lines in 
gp in 3-space would admit zero, one, two  or an entire 
continuum of common skewers.

If this is roughly correct (whatever that means), generalizations
may not be easy to formulate.

If this is wrong, I plead 'April Fool'.

From D. Hilbert and S. Cohn-Vossen, "Geometry and the Imagination",
p.164:
	"Three skew straight lines define a hyperboloid H.
	 In general, an arbitrary fourth straight line intersects H
	 at two points, althought it may also be tangent to H or lie on H".

I would consider being tangent to H or lying on H to be
not in general position.  Yet another special position occurs
when the three lines are parallel to a common plane; then you
get a hyperbolic paraboloid instead of a hyperboloid
and there are lines that cross it only once.

But you seem to be right: even in the general position there
are lines that miss the hyperboloid altogether.

The usual excuse for this sort of situation is that you should really be
working in complex space (i.e. a space where the three coordinates are
complex numbers rather than real numbers); then the statement really is
true that (in general position, so no coplanarities, no parallel planes,
and no tangencies to the hyperboloid) there are exactly two skewering lines.

So back in the original real-space, you can say that there still are
two skewering lines, you just can't see them because they're complex.
It's the same sort of thing as saying that every quadratic equation
has two solutions, even though the solutions for e.g. the equation
x^2=-1 are not on the real line.

Would you mind if I added your message to my WWW file?

Thanks for the reply on triangulation, David.

I did a search on Pick's theorem, which landed me on your geometry
junkyard, but didn't answer the question, so let me ask you this. 

Is there an analog of Pick's theorem in 3D? 

In 2D, the theorem says the area of a simple polygon with b boundary
lattice points and i interior lattice points is i + b/2 -1. One can ask
the question about the volume of a lattice non-convex polyhedron. Is there
a relation between volume and the quantities i and b? I would guess may be
not, but haven't seen anything about it... 

thanks.

There are some beautiful higher-dimensional extensions of Pick's formula
based upon recent deep work in combinatorial algebraic geometry, in
particular around toric varieties, with contributions by Brion, Cappell,
Khovanskii, Morelli, Pommersheim, Shaneson, etc.  For a readable
introduction see Morelli's paper [1], and [2] for an online start.

This is indeed a long standing problem. Usually stated as follows: Let G
be the graph with vertices the points of the plane and two points joined
if they are at distance one from each other. Then the question is: What
is the chromatic number of this graph?? (the smallest number of colours
with which the vertices can be coloured so that adjacent vertices have
different colours). This is one of Paul Erdos' pet problems and I have
heard him speak on it a couple of times. The known results (from memory
and now at least a couple of years old) are

(1) The graph can be 7-coloured  (try a hexagonal tessellation)
(2) There is a configuration that requires 4 colours (the one demanded
by the Putnam problem will do)

Thus, if chi is the chromatic number then  4 < chi < 7.

Other than that the true number could be anywhere... A typical combinatorial
puzzler - easy to state, impossible to prove. 

A further result due to Erdos is that if this graph requires k colours, then
some FINITE subgraph of it also requires k colours. However there is no
immediate reason to believe that if there IS a configuration that requires
5 colours then it is on less than <billions> of vertices  (substitute your
own large number).

Similar problems have also been studied for the integer line (where you
join two integers if they differ by an amount in some fixed set - say
{1,2,5} or whatever). 

This is all from memory and I have no references, so anyone with more
up-to-date info please feel free to correct me...

Here is a pretty good list of references for the chromatic number of
the plane (i.e., how many colors do you need so that no two points 1
away are the same color) up to around 1982 (though the publication
dates are up to 1985). This asks for the chromatic number of the graph
where two points in R^2 are connected if they are distance 1 apart.
Let this chromatic number be chi(2) and in general let chi(n) be the
chromatic number of R^n. By a theorem in [2] this is equivalent to
finding what the maximum chromatic number of a finite subgraph of this
infinite graph is.

\begin{sloppypar}

Euclidean Ramsey Theory started with the famous Hadwiger-Nelson problem:
how many colors are needed to color the points of the plane if no two points
at unit distance receive the same color.
After surveying some of the most important results in this field, we prove 
some new theorems in low dimensions.
For instance, for any rectangle $T$ and for any $2$-coloring of the points
of the $5$-dimensional Euclidean space, one can always find a
rectangle $T'$ congruent to $T$, all of whose vertices are of
the same color. 
This improves a result of 
Erd\H{o}s-Graham-Montgomery-Rothschild-Spencer-Straus.

There is of course a proof in Euclid's Elements, which can be found
online in a few places: here is the entry I have from my Geometry
Junkyard (http://www.ics.ici.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/), reformatted
somewhat from the original HTML:

  Euclid's Elements (http://www.columbia.edu/~rc142/Euclid.html).
  Online, in interesting colors, without all those annoying proofs.
  Also see D. Joyce's Java-animated version
  (http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html),
  and a manuscript excerpt from a copy in the Bodleian library made in the
  year 888 (http://www.lib.virginia.edu/science/parshall/elementsamp.html).

Of those, Joyce's is the only one likely to have the proof you're looking for.
He also has pointers to more online copies of Euclid.

It wouldn't hurt to try reading a few actual books, too, as well as just
looking online -- contrary to appearances there's a lot of knowledge out
there that hasn't been put on the web yet.  Most of my geometry books
are in my office, but I just took a look at The Penguin Dictionary of
Curious and Interesting Geometry, by David Wells, which has the exact
citation to Euclid (book I, prop. 47), gives a Chinese proof from before
200BC, and says "far more proofs have been offered of Euclid's theorem
than of any other proposition in mathematics" (maybe true but it's
hardly the only statement with many proofs; see e.g. my page on Euler's
formula, http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/).  Wells does
list several other proofs and gives citations for more including a 1940
book with 367 of them!

Some more historical background on the Pythagorean theorem can be found
in Dirk Struik's Consise History of Mathematics, which includes for
instance a statement that there is no evidence of ancient Egyptian
knowledge of the theorem (contra folklore that they used 3-4-5 triangles
to measure right angles).  Struik does say though that the theorem was
known to the Babylonians and ancient Chinese, although "the first
general proof may have been obtained in the Pythagorean school".

Let the dodecahedron have height h and face area A. One can
decompose it into 12 pentagonal pyramids of base area A and
height h/2. Then the volume of the dodecahedron is
12((h/2)A/3) = 2Ah. It suffices to show that the bottom piece
has volume 2Ah/3. This piece is a frustum of a pentgonal pyramid.
Its top face has area tau^2 A where tau =(1+sqrt(5))/2.
(This comes from tau being the ratio of diagonal to side of a
regular pentagon.) Let h_1 and h_2 be the heights of the bottom
and central pieces. Then 2h_1 + h_2 = h. We need to determine h_1.
But the ratio of (h_1 + h_2) to h_1 is the same as the ratio of the
distance of the vertices A_1 and A_2 from the side A_3 A_4 in the
regular pentagon A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5, and is seen to be tau.
Then we find h_1 = tau^{-2}h and h_2 = tau^{-3}h. (Naturally
everything is in golden ratio). We can express the frustum in
question as the "difference" of two pentagonal pyramids. Let d be
the height of the smaller of these, so that d + h_1 is the height
of the larger. Then the ratio of d + h_1 to d is the same as the
ratio of the sidelengths of the bases of the pyramids, i.e., it is
tau. Thus d = tau^{-1}h and d + h_1 = h. Thus the large pyramid
has volume (tau^2 A)h/3 and the small one has volume A tau^{-1}h/3.
Thus the frustum has volume (tau^2-tau^{-1})Ah/3 = 2Ah/3.

Not an integration in sight! I'm sure Euclid could have come up
with such an argument.

Cute problem -- one that forces me to question my usual assumptions.
I've also seen Mylar baloons made like this.  I'm not sure there is a
smooth surface formed by two squares sealed at the edges, containing a
nonzero volume, but of course you didn't say it had to be smooth.  You
can fill each of the four corners out into a circular cone, but then it
seems like you need some kind of crumpling in the middle of each square
to get it to match up with the cones, and I don't understand what that
part should look like.  Do you have a solution?

I do not have a solution but I think crumpling is unavoidable.
There is the possibility that the deformation can not be carried out at all.
If you get any ideas I would be interested to hear them.
The problem came from my wife who is a school teacher.  As a project for
pupils they decided to investigate a claim by a tea bag maufacturer that his 
new tetrahedral tea bags gave the tea twice as much space to brew.  In a 
simple minded way she got them to work out  the volume of a tetrahedron
and then turned to the "easy" case of the square bags....disaster.

Wine boxes have a rectangular Mylar bag.

I am trying to get a reasonably sharp upper bound.  I.e. better than the
sphere.

I liked your pages.
There is a lot of geometry to discover yet!

Good luck

I spent the morning playing with origami models -- it turns out that you
can fold the two squares to surround a nonzero volume, without any
bending or crumpling away from the few well-defined folds.

For instance, by folding each square along vertical and horizontal lines
1/4 and 3/4 of the way across, you get a tic-tac-toe-board like pattern,
which with some additional diagonal folds near each corner can be made
to surround a 1/2 by 1/2 by 1/2 cube (total volume: 1/8),
with some triangular flaps hanging off four of the edges.

Dan Hirschberg pointed out to me that instead folding on lines 1/6 and
5/6 of the way across, you get a rectangular box with slightly bigger
volume, 4/27.

Neither of these likely resembles the true optimum solution, but they do
at least show that some solution is actually possible.  Actually, my
intuition is that there may not be an optimum solution, rather that some
sequence of suboptimal folded solutions converges to an optimum that
can't actually be reached without an infinite amount of folding.  Maybe
this is what you mean by "the deformation can not be carried out"?

I got another prettier origami-like solution from Hirschberg, who worked
it out over the weekend.

Take each square, and crease it along lines running at 22.5 degree
angles from each corner.  Ugly ASCII graphical rendition:

    ------------
   |. .
   | .  . .
   | .      . .
   |  .         .
   |   .
   |   .
   |    .

(If you're doing this by hand, you might find it easiest to make a light
crease along the square's diagonals first, then you can make the 22.5deg
creases by folding each edge onto the diagonal.)

These creases will meet each other at the four corners of a small square,
diagonal to the original square.  Crease also the edges of these squares
(with the crease direction matching that of the 22.5 degree creases --
in origami terms, make all creases so far "mountain folds").

Finally, make short creases perpendicularly from each corner of the
small diagonal square to the nearest edge of the large square, the
opposite direction ("valley folds").

Join the edges of these creased squares together, and expand them to
form a shape that looks like a cubical box with the two small diagonal
squares as two opposite sides, and with tall pyramids extending from the
remaining four sides to each of the corners of the original squares.
So the boundary of this shape is formed by the two small squares and
sixteen 45-67.5-67.5 isosceles triangles.

According to Dan, this shape's volume is roughly 0.1751
(compared with 0.1250 and 0.1481 for the rectangular boxes I described
earlier).  Choosing angles slightly different from 22.5deg produces a
slight improvement, to 0.1756.

This is starting to look closer to what the mylar balloons actually end
up shaped like...

Dear Andrew,

Well thank you for your tea bag notes.  Very interesting.  I still find it odd
that origami has become a branch of geometry.   At the moment everything
in life
seems to be geometry.  It was all Bayes theorem last month so things are
improving.

I am interested in the infinitesimal stuff.  Transforms with no shear and no
stretch are very constrained.  Transforms that leave the length around any
closed
curve invariant are interesting too.  This is mathematical netting (string
bags
with very small mesh) or cloth.   There should be a maximum value for
stuffing a
square string bag too.  I expect the shape and volume to be very similar
to the
tea bag.

My email address has changed (or is about to change) and the new one,
which works
now, is below.

If you have any ideas on how to treat these (often rough) surfaces
mathematically
I would be very interested.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

Hi David -

Read with great interest attempts at maximizing the unit square teabag
volume. I don't know how much progress has been made on this but it
occurs to me that a curved fold might yield some benefit. The attached gif
portrays 2 curved fold lines within a unit square. Left and right edges
can be folded so that the main area raises convexedly out of the plane
with the 2 end areas becoming concave and perpendicular to the plane. This
becomes one-half of the teabag and will fit perfectly its other half. In
my 1/4 volume cardboard model (one fold) I used a circle-arc extending 1/4
the edged distance into the square. Other curves/distances might prove
more optimum such as parabolic, catenary or elliptical. I didn't calculate
the volume because it's not clear to me how to determine the resulting
curve along the fold line.

This may have already been tried - I got the idea from a McDonald's French
fry container.

Regards,

Tom Longtin

no progress at all - it is not a particularly serious project for me.

Your configuration is a nice one I hadn't thought of - I only considered
teabags with 4-fold rotational symmetry.  This was guided by the shape of
inflated wine cask liners.  I seem to have had more exposure to these in my
life than McDonald's (being vegetarian).  I did, come to the same
realisation about curved folds - they are used in my last example in the
curved pleats (half the curved triangles that jut out of the quadrant need
to be folded back in)

Some of my thoughts about your configuration:

* It should be quite easy to work out a volume if you model the main part of
the curved surface - it will only need z as (say) a function of x on an
interval [-a,a].  For the paper not to stretch, the arc length of this
function is 1.  The volume is then the integral of z(1-z).  I would suggest
trying a class of functions (e.g. arcs) with a single parameter (e.g.
angle), then using 1-variable calculus or numerical methods.
* If you have the skills, this would be one where variational method, such
as is used to get the catenary as the chain curve.  I would expect that the
formulae in this calculus of variations calculation would be would neater
than for any of the configurations I dreamed up, but this does not mean that
it would be easy.
* From an intuitive perspective, I guess that having the corners on a square
would be optimal.  If you can get hold of a wine cask liner and safely
dispose of its contents (easier said than done, although they are also used
for 5 litre OJ boxes over here) then you might be able to convince yourself
of this.
* Your configuration can be inflated slightly more by slanting the vertical
sides -- this will make them project below the plane, and so another curved
fold would be required, making a curved pleat like I used between the cones
in my last example.  This was my very first step in this problem, converting

If I get an idle moment, I may try the variational problem.

Let me know if you get anywhere - I could link or include it.

Your idea of using curved folds for the teabag problem is fascinating --
would you mind if I added your message to my page?

I'm thinking the volume computations might be easier to work through if
you specified the eventual cross section of the folded figure, rather than
the shape of the curve.  All you need is to specify a given convex curve
y=f(x) with f(w/2)=f(-w/2)=0 for some w<1, where the length of the curve
from (-w/2,0) to (w/2,0) is 1; then it's possible to fold a shape
that in cross-section looks like that curve, and viewed from above
looks like a 1 by w rectangle, with indentations in the shape of the
same curve.

E.g. if the cross-section is a semicircle of length 1 (so radius 1/pi),
you can form a shape that is a circular cylinder of radius 1/pi
and length 1, minus two cylindrical indentations at the two short ends.
The flattened shape of the fold is not a circle,
but is instead a sine curve.

The two indentations can be reassembled to form a shape that is the
intersection of two of these cylinders.  So the volume of the overall
shape is the same as that of the unindented cylinder (1/pi) minus the
two-cylinder intersection (16/3pi^3 unless I've miscalculated).

1/pi - 16/3pi^3 ~ 0.1463, rather worse than the current best solution
1.902, but maybe a semicircular cross-section is not best...

If two curved folds are good, maybe four curved folds (one on each side
of the square) are even better?

HI Tom,

Folds along arcs, or at least the type I have considered (of which yours
is an example) are quite easy.  So long as the fold ends up being all
in one plane, you consider this a mirror plane through which one part
of the paper is reflected.  Then the condition on it being foldable is
that the unfolded (i.e. configuration with the mirrored bit un-mirrored)
sheet is bendable - usually a cone or cylinder of some cross-section.

To get the slanted side of your chip cup (umm *fries*, sorry) to work,
say with a circular cross-section of the main (horizontal) bit, you need
therefore to have a circular cylinder in the near-vertical section,
with the curve of intersection being an arc of an ellipse (in some
slanted plane)  This means that the fold-line (when unwrapped) will
be an arc of a sine curve.  By similar reasoning, the curve where
the near-vertical side cuts through the horizontal base-plane will again
be an ellipse, but appear as a sine curve before folding.  Same wavelength,
smaller amplitude, at a guess.

On the other hand, if you start out with an arc of a circle as your
fold-line, my guess is that an arc of an ellipse would give you the
other fold.  Probably one where the major axis is equal to the
diameter of the circular arc.  However, I have no idea what the profile
of the surface would be.

I'm looking at a circular curved fold which extends nearly to the center
of the square whereby the concave end can no longer be vertical and
maintain all edges in the plane - it needs to be inclined inwards thus
reducing the volume. Apparently a shallower curve would allow the concave
end to slant outwards. I guess my initial try with the curve extending 1/4
into the square just happened to align vertically with the edges remaining
in the plane. Needs work!

Gentlemen -

I thought this fold worth considering - haven't worked out the volume tho.
Instead of 2 curved folds 4 worked OK with cardboard - one at each edge.
In teabag2.gif the inner diamond would remain planar with a ruled surface
from each of its edges to the outer corners. As before with 2 curved
folds, the concave sides need to be vertical so the 4 outer edges remain
in a plane.

taken an interest in formulating the correct account of the efficiency of a

judgement to assume muddle in the almighty powers of the teabag.  Surly
something, which as evolved form square too circular and finally into

lied dormant.

If disturbed it will cause sure Disaster upon all of humanity.

I ran a couple of experiments with water-filled plastic bags.
One formed of two 102mm squares[1] weighed 7.7 oz (about 218 g)
and one of two 114mm squares weighed 9.5 oz (about 269 g)
which (assuming one g per ml of water) leads to volume 
ratios of .2057 and .182, respectively, which is fairly
large experimental variation but still indicates that the
"0.2055+ achieved" ratio mentioned in the webpage is pretty
good.

Retraction. (this was the last posting in the thread)

An further reflection and a little playing with paper cutouts, a flat
bag of the kind described can certainly enclose a parallelopiped which
is a/2 x a/2 x (b - a/4)  This accounts for a basic volume of (28 -
5.25)*(10.5^2) or 2508.1875 and leaves flat triangular tabs.  If the
parallelopiped were stretched into a cylinder, the volume would be
3193.58.  The most additional volume possible would be if the two
triangular tabs formed in order to create the parallelopiped could be
filled.  These are each a units in circumference at the base and a/4
units high.  If filled, each could account for  the volume contained
in a cone a/2 units high and a units in circumference at the base.
This works out to 61.418 cc per tab.  Thus the upper bound on total

G'day Teabaggers,

If I understand the note from Narasimham G.L., my "second solution"
	http://maths.newcastle.edu.au/~andrew/teabag/#TWO
includes the configuration discussed below as the "degenerate case" 
where the triangular facets have zero size.  I worked out the volume 
as pi * 2^(1/2) * (3^(1/2) - 1)/16 which is 2.03276003.  My best 
solution is around 0.2055.  2/pi^2=3D2.02642367 would have been a neat 
solution, but we have already passed it.  On the other hand, no-one 
has verified my calculations ...

My 2.055 is not optimal either -- the profile of the cone can be 
perturbed from being circular for some gain.  A rough variational 
argument convinced me that the property of the optimal profile curve 
is that the radius of curvature is proportional to the length of the 
side of the cone before it hits the axis planes.  (See the image of 
1/8 of the teabag on the above page for what I mean by this distance.)

Note that "radius of curvature" for a cone needs to be defined 
properly -- it can be done in terms of the tan of the slant angle, or 
equivalently, a section through the cone at distance 1.

Getting a profile curve from this invariant property is another 
matter, though.  A finite-element simulation may be the only way.

Cheers, Andrew

Nice argument.  But it looks like n=5 is impossible even for non-integer 
lattices in R^d: the intersection of the lattice with the plane containing 
the pentagon would have to itself be a planar lattice, but no planar 
lattice can contain the vertices of a regular pentagon, for if one had 
vertices abcde (say, in clockwise order) then (a+d-e) (b+e-a) (c+a-b) 
(d+b-c) (e+c-d) would be the vertices of a smaller pentagon, ad infinitum.

I was looking through the "puzzles" section of a used bookstore and
I found a book that looked kind of interesting.  Sure, it had the usual
suspects (e.g. Towers of Hanoi), but it also had one puzzle which I'd never
seen before.  I bought the book (for a buck) and read it through.  As it
turns out, it's an awful book, but this one puzzle intrigues me.

The book is awful because the puzzles are poorly described (as if someone had
taken a month worth of the net and published it without editorial change)
and the answers aren't always the clearest or most elegant solutions.

I would cite the book, but I don't have it here.  Nonetheless, here's the puzzle
(hopefully described more clearly than in the book):

Suppose you have a line segment (it can be of unit length, if you want - that
doesn't really matter).  Now you are going to play a little game:

1. Place a point (anywhere) on the segment and mark it #1
2. Divide the segment into two even pieces (at 1/2).  Now, unless you've chosen
   0.5 for your first point, that point is in one of the two sides of the
   segment.  Put another point (let's call it #2) anywhere in the other side.
3. Now, divide the original segment into three equal pieces.   If you're lucky, 
   #1 and #2 are in different sub-segments.  Add a third point (#3) anywhere in 
   the third segment.
4. Now, divide the segment into 4 equal sub-segments...

Once a point has been placed, you can't move it.
Repeat this exercise until two points end up in the same sub-segment.  That's
when you lose.  What is the maximum number of points you can put on the line?

Example:

|--1--------------------|

|--1--------.---------2-|

|--1----.--3----.-----2-|

|--1--.----3.----4.---2-|

|--1-.---5.3---.-4--.-2-|  (OK, it's hard to divide 24/5 in ASCII)

|--1.---.5-3.---.4---.2-|

Now we're stuck because #5 and #3 are in the same sub-segment and there are
two empty sub-segments where #6 needs to go.

The book claims that 17 (I think) is THOUGHT to be the highest attainable 
number of points.  This seems to be imminently discernable using standard
search techniques (and a fast machine).  Am I right?

What's the poop?  Any pointers.

Given a centrally symmetric convex compact body K in 3-space and a point
p on its surface, the point on the surface farthest from p in the surface
metric need not be the antipode of p.  (Cf. the Knuth-Kotani puzzle,
which asks one to find the point on the surface of a 1-by-1-by-2 box
that is farthest from one of the corners; it is not the opposite corner.)

However, one might still conjecture that the maximum distance between
two points in the surface metric, as BOTH of them vary over the surface,
is achieved by a pair of antipodal points.  (This is believed to be true
in the case of an a-by-b-by-c box for all a, b, and c, though to my
knowledge no proof is known even for this very special case.)

Can anyone prove or disprove the conjecture?  (Is the convexity condition
necessary?)

Dear Professor Eppstein,

I would like to inform you that the open problem of
Jim Propp you propose at 
 http://www.ics.uci.edu/eppstein/junkyard/open.html
concerning antipodes on convex surfaces has been
solved.

By Proposition 6 (pp. 273) in
 Geometriae Dedicata 79: 267-275 (2000),
two points realizing the intrinsic diameter of a
centrally symmetric convex surface must be symmetric
(under the same symmetry).

The proof holds more generally, for any centrally
symmetric surface of genus 0.

I proposed there the following problem:
 Prove or disprove that, if on a centrally symmetric
convex surface every point x has an unique farthest
point F(x) then x and F(x) must be symmetric (under
the same symmetry).
(Notice that on boxes there are points with two
farthest points.)

Meanwhile this problem was also solved -getting a
negative answer- and appears in a short joint paper
written with Prof. T. Zamfirescu, my thesis advisor.
This paper is not yet published.

Sincerely Yours,
Costin VILCU

Here is the promised summary of responses.  My comments are in

considering the time taken by an algorithm to generate a "randon n-gon".

Many thanks to everyone who replied.

From:           Dan Hoey <hoey@etl.army.mil>

You might want to choose vertices from your distribution until the
convex hull is an N-gon.  I think for nice distributions this
terminates with probability one.

[ For N points chosen uniformly from inside a circle the expected
[ number of vertices on the convex hull is O(N^(1/3)) [1].  So we would
[ have to pick O(N^3) points to generate a convex N-gon.  This gives an
[ obvious O(N^4) algorithm.  If I generate points outside the convex
[ hull of the points generated so far,  I find that I only have to
[ generate about 3N points to get an N-gon, so this seems to be an O(N)
[ algorithm. ]

The problem is that the distribution of vertices that results is not
the original one--the points near the center are less likely.

[ Yes.  If I take a large number of points from inside a circle then
[ their convex hull will closely approximate the circle.  This does not
[ seem very random. ]

I don't know if there's any way to pick them so that you end up with
a desired distribution.

From:           ccrwest!ed@UCSD.EDU (Ed Bender)

Three thoughts come to mind, none very good in terms of randomness.

1. Continue choosing points until their convex hull is an n-gon.

2. Choose n rays from the origin so that every open half plane contains a
   ray---easy to do by choosing sets of n at random until a set is okay.
   Proceeding around the rays in a clockwise manner choose a point on each
   ray to be the vertex of a convex n-gon that contains the origin.  The
   first two points are arbitrary and then the previous two points (and also
   first two when choosing the nth) may put a simple upper bound on how far out
   the next point can be.

[ You also need a lower bound on how far out the next point is, to
[ ensure that it is outside the convex hull of the points selected so
[ far.  Later points have far less freedom than earlier points.  This
[ doesn't seem very random. ]

3. Choose n angles at random summing to 360 degrees.  These are the angles
   to rotate through when moving from one side to the next.  Choose the first
   two n-2 side lengths at random.  The lengths of the two remaining sides
   are determined and, if you are lucky, they will not be negative.  If a
   negative side arises, try again.  I have no idea what the probability of
   failure is.

From:           Marshall Bern <bern@parc.xerox.com>

Here's a sketch of an idea due to Thurston (who told David Dobkin
who told me):  Start with a regular n-gon.  Pick a random velocity
(direction uniform on [0, 2 pi ], magnitude uniform on [0,1]) for
each vertex.  Now let each vertex move at its velocity.  When three
consecutive vertices, a, b, c, become co-linear, you "bounce" b
off the segment ac.  To do this, you could consider the frame of reference
in which b is the origin and segment ac is fixed and horizontal, and
then change the velocity of b to its reflection across the y-axis.

[ Cool idea.  It would even make a pretty display on your screen if you
[ animated it.  You do the bouncing in a non-inertial frame of
[ reference, so the total energy of the system isn't fixed, but I guess
[ that doesn't matter.  Implement with time O(log n) per bounce.
[ Presumably you need O(n) bounces to get things random enough, so
[ O(n log n).  A cheaper way to get a similar effect would be to
[ randomly pick vertices and move them so as not to destroy the
[ convexity. (If ABCDE are five consecutive vertices then we can move
[ C anywhere inside the triangle BDI where I is the intersection of
[ the rays AB and ED.)

Thurston told Dobkin that in the limit, "every convex n-gon is
equally likely".  I'm not sure what the proper mathematical statement
would be.  You'd have to define a measure on the space of convex polygons.

[ It doesn't converge to a limit.  Maybe you should do some simulating
[ annealing kind of stuff and gradually cool the system down so that
[ the vertices eventually grind to a halt.]

From:           David.Handscomb@na.oxford.ac.uk

The definition that springs first to my mind is described by the
following algorithm:

repeat:
choose n points from given distribution;
if any one lies within triangle formed by any other three then go to repeat
else accept last n points chosen;

[ Or in other words "Pick n points.  Reject if their convex hull does
[ not have n points."

This is equally valid in d>2 dimensions, replacing "triangle" by
"simplex" and "three" by "d+1".

It is a nice problem to determine how many repetitions are required on
average to generate one polygon.  For n=4, d=2, with points chosen from
a uniform distribution on a square, the number appears experimentally to
be around 1.44 - could possibly be worked out exactly.

[ Sylvester's problem [2] is "Find the probability that four random
[ points from a convex set form a convex quadrilateral."  For a
[ parallelogram the answer is 25/36, so the expected number of
[ repetitions is _exactly_ 1.44 -- your experiment was spot on!

The number must increase as n increases, but at what (asymptotic) rate?

[ Good question.  Anyone know the answer? ]

When n is large, is there a more efficient way of generating
convex polygons from the same distribution?

[ I'm glad you asked.  First pick three points.  Now if the the next
[ point is inside the triangle or the wedges opposite its corners we'll
[ have to reject and start again.  Let p = probability of rejection.
[ Rather than risk rejection, we'll pick a point outside the rejection
[ region and multiply the probability of the polygon by (1-p).
[ Continue until you get an n-gon and a probability of getting there.
[ Time is O(n).  We can use the probability to weight whatever
[ measurements we make an the n-gon.

From:           "William F. Eddy" <bill+@andrew.cmu.edu>

Perhaps the easiest way to generate random convex polygons is to
generate random samples of points and just take the convex hull.  There
has been a fair amount of work over the last twenty five years or so
working out properties of the resulting convex hulls under various
sampling assumptions.   This method does not allow you to prespecify
the number of vertices (except for various particular sampling
distributions) so you have to reject all those not having the specified
number.

[ i.e. pick a random integer k between 1 and infinity.  Reject if the
[ convex hull of k points does not form an n-gon.  This seems to be
[ closely related to "keep taking points until the convex hull is an
[ n-gon".  Maybe you should keep going to see if you ever get an n-gon
[ again, and randomly choose amongst the n-gons you get.

I can provide additional details and references if you wish.

From:           mic@theory.lcs.mit.edu (Michelangelo Grigni)

Here is an idea, using random sides rather than points.

First a simple version, for a random centrally symmetric 2n-gon:

1) Choose n "random" vectors v1, v2, ... vn,
   by your favorite random point distribution (say normal).
2) Change signs of the vectors if necessary so that they all
   point in the positive x direction.
3) Sort the vectors by increasing slope.
4) Now start at some arbitrary starting point (say the origin), and
   make the following relative moves, tracing out a 2n-sided polygon:
            +v1, +v2, +v3, ..., +vn, -v1, -v2, ..., -vn.   
   This returns you to where you started.

[ You can implement this in time O(n) (even though the sort would
[ take O(n log n) ]

This actually has a few nice properties.  Let H be the set of 2^n
points obtained by summing subsets of the v's.  Then the polygon we
traced out is the convex hull of H, and furthermore all step 2 did was
translate H, so we see the distribution of polygon shapes is
rotationally symmetric, assuming our original point distribution was.

Now for a random convex n-gon, you would need the same basic idea but
with the constraint v1+v2+...+vn=0.  In general I don't know how you
might do this.  One idea: to get n random real variables summing to 0,
so that each has the same normal distribution, first take n
independent normal variables, then orthogonally project them to the
constraint plane.

[ Yes.  And if you want them from the uniform distribution on the n-1
[ dimensional hypersphere formed by the intersection of the constraint
[ plane and the n-dim unit ball, you can pick a point from the
[ (n-1)-dim unit ball and rotate it onto the constraint plane.  This
[ is the simplest to implement.  Time is O(n log n) (because you have
[ to sort the vectors). ]

From:           "Matti Siivola (KTTL) puh. 4346609, 8744283" <MSIIVOLA@cc.Helsinki.FI>

My idea would be to first create "star-shaped" n-polygon by choosing n
angles from 0 to 2*pi and n distances from origin.  Then I would swap
any two adjanced edges which common end is "inside" to "outside".
Repeating this will provide a convex polygon.

[ Hmm.  You would have to do the swap so that the angle of the moved
[ vertex did not change, so that it is still star-shaped.  I'm not
[ sure how quickly this would converge.  It seems to me you might need
[ O(n^2) swaps.

Another way is to start with a random triangle (it is always convex).
Then cut away a randomly chosen corner at random points on the edges.
This gives 4-gon.  Repeat until a n-gon is obtained.

[ This is dual to the method I described that selects points subject
[ to the constaint that the convex hull of n points be an n-gon.

I too am interested in these definitions. May be a generalization of
that would be something like "Define a n vertex random polytope

To probabilists, there is a natural way of defining random convex
polygons.  A random convex polygon is a polygon selected from a random
tessellation of the plane.  A random tessellation is most easily
defined by randomly drawing lines in the plane, according to a
translation-invariant, isotropic `line process'.

To explain what I mean by this, consider the 1-dimensional analogue.
In 1-d we can `randomly choose points' (i.e. define the standard
Poisson point process) as follows.  Fix one point at the origin, and
let the distance to the next point on either side be an exponential
random variable.  Continue ad infinitum.  (Actually this yields a
conditioned Poisson process, since the first point is tied down at the
origin.  With a bit more work, we can define a stationary, i.e.
translation-invariant Poisson process, or more general renewal
processes.)

These randomly chosen points partition the line into intervals; they
are `random intervals'.  If we require the left end of a random
interval to be the origin, then it will be [0,x], with x exponentially
distributed.

The generalization to 2 dimensions is simple but not obvious.  We need
to define a `line process', i.e. we need to draw lines randomly, in a
translation-invariant, isotropic way.  It is left as exercise to the
reader to show that the following construction will suffice.

Distribute points along the x axis, according to the standard Poisson
process.  Draw a line through each point, but choose its orientation
randomly.  Denote by theta the angle that it makes with the x axis.
Then the appropriate probability density is proportional to the square
of the sine of theta.

It is not hard to show that if we choose any fixed line in the plane,
the intersections of our randomly chosen lines with it will form a
Poisson point process.  So our line process is a natural 2-D
generalization of the 1-D point process.  (The Poisson process seems
to be the only renewal process that will work here.)

We may define a `random convex polygon' as a minimal convex polygon
formed by the crossing of our random lines.  If we require that one of
its vertices be the origin, we can use the conditioned Poisson process
rather than the unconditioned Poisson process.

This definition of random convex polygon is unusual because it does
not fix n, the number of vertices of the polygon.  It is also a bit
difficult to implement.  In principle one would have to generate all
the random points along the x axis, and their associated lines, in
order to determine the number of edges of the convex polygons touching
the origin.  That is because parts of their boundaries could be formed
by lines emanating from points on the x-axis arbitrarily far away.

But this is a very elegant way of defining random convex polygons.
Can anyone think of a simple way of conditioning on n, i.e. imposing

I would define a "random simple n-gon" as the output of one of the
following random processes.

(a) Generate a sequence p_1, p_2, ... p_n of n points uniformly at
random in the unit square (or whatever domain you want).  Repeat until
the "polygon" p_1p_2...p_n is simple.  Output the polygon p_1p_2...p_n.

(b) Generate a set {p_1,p_2,...p_n} of n points uniformly at random from
the unit square (or whatever domain you want).  Generate the list of all
simple polygons with vertices p_1,p_2,...,p_n in some order.  Output a
randomly chosen polygon from this list.

I would be VERY surprised if these two processes generated the same
probability distribution.  I'll let somebody else decide which
distribution is the "right" one.

Obviously, both of these procedures will take a LONG time.  It is an
open question whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm that
generates a random polygon with the same distribution as either of the
two processes above, or to uniformly generate a simple polygon with a
given set of vertices, or to determine how many simple polygons there
are with a given vertex set.  Even the following question is open: What
is the largest number of simple polygons that use the same set of n
vertices, as a function of n?  (If you replace "largest" with
"smallest", the answer is 1; consider n points on a circle.)

There are polynomial-time algorithms for other similar random polygon
problems: generating random convex polygons [P. Valtr, The probability
that n random points are in convex position, Disc. Comput. Geom.
13:637-643, 1995], random monotone polygons using a given vertex set [C.
Zhu, G. Sundharam, J. Snoeyink, and J.S.B. Mitchell, Generating random
polygons with given vertices, Comput. Geom. Theory Appl. 6:277-290,
1996], and random star-shaped polygons using a given vertex set [T. Auer
and M. Held, Heuristics for the generation of random polygons, In Proc.
8th Canad. Conf. Comput. Geom., pp.38-44, 1996].

Thomas Auer and Martin Held have a piece of software that implements
several heuristics for generating random polygons:
	http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/rpg/rpg.html
You can download the full version of their CCCG paper, which explains
the heuristics they use, from the same Web page.

Heidi Burgiel and Michelle Raymond have written a Java applet that
counts the number of simple polygons with a given vertex set:
	http://www.geom.umn.edu/~burgiel/Java/Ngons/ngons.html
The source code isn't available, but based on the speed of the applet, I
suspect it essentially tries all possible permutations and looks for
intersections.

Yup.  This is discussed in the papers by Auer+Held and by Zhu et al. 
For example, Zhu et al. consider a Markov chain heuristic that starts
with an arbitrary simple polygon and performs random "2OPT moves" --
delete a pair of edges and reconnect the two resulting pieces the only
other possible way, but backtrack if you get something nonsimple.  They
show that for a certain set of 6 points (the vertices of two nested
triangles), some polygons are more likely than others in the limit.

I suppose it depends on what you mean by "push in the polygon".  If a
"pushing step" consists of deleting a random edge of the polygon and
connecting its endpoints to a random point on the "inside" of the
deleted edge, you can get spirals.

Well...the only test that would really satisfy me would be to examine
your algorithm and prove it.  

You could certainly define distributions on random polygons based on the
measures you suggest.  For example: uniformly generate a set of n real
numbers in the interval (-pi,pi) whose sum is 2pi, and then (somehow)
generate a simple poylgon with those turning angles.  Or: uniformly
generate a set of n numbers between 0 and 1, and then (somehow) generate
a simple polygon with those edge lengths.  Of course, these are
different distributions than the "uniform" distributions described
earlier.

This brings up all sort of icky complexity-theoretic issues about
distinguishing pseudorandomness from randomness.

This is wide open.

It suffices to compute the probability that the segments pq and rs
intersect, where p,q,r,s are generated uniformly in the unit square, and
then multiply by n(n-3)/2, the number of nonadjacent pairs of edges.

The probability that p,q,r,s are in convex position is 25/36.  [For a
proof of this fact, see H. Solomon, Geometric Probability, SIAM,
Philadeplhia, 1987.]  If p,q,r,s are in convex position, then pq
intersects rs with probability 2/3.  If the points are not in convex
position, ie, one point is inside the convex hull of the other three,
then the two segments cannot intersect.  So the probability of
intersection is exactly 25/36 * 2/3 = 25/54.

So the expected number of intersections is 25n(n-3)/108.

(or maybe they should be called "ball-packings")

Consider hyperbolic space H^n (the unique smooth simply-connected Riemannian
n-manifold of constant sectional curvature = -1).

For each radius r > 0, one can ask the "Kepler question"

   K(n,r):  What is the (or a) densest packing of H^n by balls of radius r ???

However, there are certain problems of well-definedness that arise:

Let Q(n,r) denote the set of all packings of H^n by closed balls of radius r 
(where a packing is a collection of such balls any two of which are are either 
disjoint or tangent).

For any q in Q(n,r) we let U(q) denote the union of all the balls of q, and
we let q(R; x) denote those points of U(q) that lie within a distance R 
of the point x of H^n.

Given a packing q in Q(n,r), we can define the density d(q; x) as follows:

           d(q; x) =   lim    vol(q(R; x)) / vol(B(R)), 
                      R -> oo

if this limit exists, where B(R) denotes a ball of radius R in H^n.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONS:

1.	Given a packing q in Q(n,r), if d(q; x) exists for one x in H^n, does
        it necessarily exist and have the same value for all x ???

Consider the packings q in Q(n,r) for which d(q; x) exists and is 
independent of x.  (In this case we denote d(q; x) by d(q).) 

Let supden(n,r) denote the supremum of all such d(q).  

2.      Must there exist a packing q0 such that d(q0) = supden(n,r) ???

3.      Given n, is supden(n,r) a continuous function of r ???   Monotone ???

3.	Especially for n = 2 or n = 3, for which values of r is there an 
	explicit packing q in Q(n,r) that is known to realize supden(n,r) ???
        What about higher dimensions???

[d(q;x) here is defined as the limit of the proportion covered
of round balls centered at x.]

Certainly not, given that in the hyperbolic plane, a cone with an angle 
of 5 degrees contains a half-plane.

I doubt it, although I don't have a counterexample.

There is a theorem due to Borocky that if you take a Delaunay simplex
associated to a hyperbolic sphere packing, the proportion covered
covered by the spheres is maximized when the simplex is regular.  If
this simplex tiles spaces, then I believe that you get an example of
the kind you want.  There is such a triangle with angles of 2*pi/n for
every n>7 in the plane, and there is a regular simplex in four
hyperbolic dimensions with angles of 2*pi/5.  The ideal simplex in
three dimensions has angles of pi/3, which gives you a horoball packing
which is also optimal in the sense of Borocky; I don't know if
horoballs are okay for you.

I am posting this message on behalf of
a friend of mine. Please send all
replies to the address given below.
---------------------------------------------

Given a convex polytope in d dimensions, I would like to
triangulate it (into d-simplices) which has one
of the following two properties

 1.  Any line (1-face) intersects at most $O(\log N)$
   simplices (if the polytope has N vertices)

            or

 2. Every vertex is incident on a number of simplices
     which does not depend on N (can depend on d).

 In 2 dimensions there are triangulation schemes where
 properties 2 or 3 can be satisfied. In 3-D property 2
 can be satisfied but I could not come up with a scheme
 to satisfy property 3. For d > 3, I could not come up
 with anything. I am not even sure if such decomposition
 is possible in higher dimensions or how close can one
 get to the above conditions. More specifically, I would
be resaonably happy to know about triangulation schemes
 for which the bounds in (2) or (3) are $O(\log^{d} N)$.

 I will be very grateful if someone can provide me with
 some useful pointers (of course an answer is always
 welcome). The motivation behind this query is algorithmic
 application.

Karl Rubin (rubin@function.mps.ohio-state.edu) has observed the following

and wondered whether sci.math readers could do any better:

Let L_0,L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4 be five lines in general position on the Euclidean
plane---think of the subscripts mod 5 and draw L_i as the consecutive lines
of a (not necessarily regular!) pentagram.  Let C_i be the circle inscribed
about the triangle formed by L_i, L_{i-2}, and L_{i+2}.  Then C_{i-1} and
C_{i+1} meet at the intersection of L_{i-1} and L_{i+1}, and again at some
other point P_i (which we take to be the same point if the two circles are
tangent there).  Show that these five points P_i are concyclic.

I haven't really thought about this, but the statement seems to be very
much in the spirit of some theorems due to Steiner,Wallace, de Lonchamps,
Miquel and Bath which are described in an obituary notice of Frederick Bath
written by W.L.Edge (Proc. Edinburgh Math. Soc (1983) vol.26, pp.279-281.
I quote from the discussion of Bath's Theorem on p.280:

"One must now speak of Bath's Theorem.  A plane quadrilateral affords,
by omitting each of its sides in turn, four triangles; their four circumcircles
have a common point P (Wallace's Theorem) and their four circumcentres are on 
a circle C (Steiner). Five coplanar lines, no three concurrent, afford, 
by omitting each in  turn, five quadrilaterals; the five points P are on a
circle \Gamma (the Miquel circle) and the five circles C have a common 
point Q (de Longchamps). Bath's theorem is that Q is on \Gamma."

Edge remarks that Bath proved it by projecting from a figure in four 
dimensional space (F.Bath "On circles determined by five lines in a plane,"
Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. vol.35 (1939) 518-519).

Even if these results do not imply the Elkies-Rubin result, it seems
natural to look at the techniques used there for a synthetic proof.

A little thought shows (using the fact that no three lines are concurrent)
that the five points P_i constructed in the first, are the same five points
P constructed in Bath's theorem, so Bath's theorem does the trick.
In fact, there is even more information there...

This is a good example showing how useful the network can be.

Frank Morley and F. V. Morley wrote a book _Inversive_Geometry_, Ginn & Co.,
Boston, 1933, that includes a description of the complete 4-line and Wallace's
theorem, the 5-line and the Miquel circle, and the 6-line and the Clifford
point.  They complete their book with a chapter on the n-line which describes
Clifford's chain:

  The theorem of Clifford is as follows.  Two lines, say 1 and 2, have a
  common point 12.  Three lines 1, 2, 3 have three common points 12, 23, 31
  which lie on a circle 123.  Four lines have four circumcircles 123 which are
  on a point 1234.  Five lines give five such points which lie on a circle
  12345.  An so on.  We thus get the complete n-line, the lines 1,2,...,n
    meeting in (n choose 2) points 12,...
    these lying on (n choose 3) circles 123,...
    these meeting in (n choose 4) points 1234,...
  ending with a point or a circle 123...n as n is even or odd.  Regarding the
  lines as circles on the point infinity, we have the Clifford configuration
  /Gamma n of 2^(n-1) points and and 2^(n-1) circles, each point on n circles
  and each circle on n points.

This follows almost immediately from the "Ham Sandwich" Theorem.

Another well known consequence is the fact that any suitable continuous
function defined over a closed manifold will somwhere have two points
where the function takes on the same value. i.e. there are always
at least two different points on Earth with the same temperature.
(or barometric pressure or humidity or.....).

The "correct" assumptions are that the legs are arbitrarily long (but of the
same length), that the hill is given by a continuous non-negative function
defined inside a compact convex disk D, and that the table is to be 
placed on the hill in the sense that its center lies over D.  Then the
answer is yes there is such a position.  This is due to Roger Fenn,
"The Table Theorem", Bull London Math Soc 2 (1970), 73-76.  Discussion
of various generalizations (e.g., convexity of D is necessary, other
shape tables) can be found in my papers: Mark D. Meyerson, "Balancing
Acts", Topology Proceedings, Vol 6, 1981, 59-75, and "Convexity and the
Table Theorem", Pacific Journal of Mathematics, Vol 97, No 1, 1981, 
167-169.  Also see Kronheimer and Kronheimer, "The Tripos Problem", Jour
London Math Soc (2) 24 (1981), 182-192.  A related open problem is
whether every planar simple closed curve contains (as a subset of the
curve) the vertices of a square (see Klee & Wagon, Old and New Unsolved
Problems in Plane Geometry and Number Theory, Section 11, 1991, MAA).

Last I heard it was still open, although some cases (e.g. sufficiently
smooth curves) have been solved.  I have some discussion of this on my
web site, http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/jordan-square.html
and would be very interested in hearing about progress on this problem.

Here is a proof sketch for smooth curves.  I made it up, but I don't
expect it to be original; I haven't read previous proofs of similar results.

Consider the set of ordered pairs (x,y) of unequal points on the curve.
Topologically, the ordered pairs form a torus, but the restriction that
they be unequal turns this into an open annulus.  We can embed this
annulus geometrically as the set {(a,b): 1 < a^2+b^2 < 2} in such a way
that that swapping x and y corresponds to a 180degree rotation of the
annulus: -(a,b) = (-a,-b)

For each such pair (x,y) let point p(x,y) denote the corner clockwise
from x on a square having diagonal xy.  Classify the points of the
annulus as "in" if p(x,y) is inside the Jordan curve, "out" if p(x,y) is
outside the Jordan curve, and "on" if it is on the curve.  Obviously,
what we want to find is (a,b) for which (a,b) and -(a,b) are both
classified "on".

Then (for smooth curves) the points near one boundary of the annulus are
all classified "in", the points near the other boundary are all
classified "out", and the points classified "in" and "out" are both open
sets. Without loss of generality let's say that the "out" points are
along the outer boundary of the annulus.  Let S be the connected
component of the points classified "out" near this boundary of the
annulus, and consider the set (S union -S).  This is a connected open
set, topologically a multiple-punctured disk.  Consider the component of
its boundary that contains the origin.  Some of the boundary points are
cluster points of S (in particular, the point realizing the infimum of
absolute values of points in S is such a boundary point) and similarly
some of the boundary points are cluster points of -S.  So there must be
a boundary point (a,b) that is a cluster point of both S and -S.  Note
that (a,b) must be strictly interior to the annulus since all points
near the other boundary are "in".  Since it is a cluster point of the
"out" points, but not an "out" point itself (since it is on the boundary
of an open set) it must be an "on" point, and similarly -(a,b) is also
an "on" point, QED.

It looks like the proof generalizes a little, to curves such that, at
each point, the left and right derivatives make an obtuse angle.  But it
doesn't work for all Jordan curves; for instance the equilateral
triangle has both "in" and "out" points near both boundaries of the
annulus.  In this particular case, there are only a constant number of
misclassified points, presumably easily enough handled, but one could
imagine more monstrous examples in which the "in" and "out" points are
dense on both boundaries.

Maybe Holditch's theorem would help - this is just an idea:
"Take a smooth, closed convex curve and let a chord of constant lenght slide
around it. Choose a point on a moving chord, which divides it into two
parts, of lenghts p and q. This point will trace out a new closed curve as
the chord moves. Then, provided certain simple conditions are satisfied, the
area between the two curves will be pi*p*q." Ref: William Bender, The
Holditch's curve Tracer, Mathematics Magazine, March 1981.

Iff p=q we have used as a chord "a diameter of a circle" that has the middle
point, because p=q. Therefore the centre of the circle draws the new closed
curve inside the original closed convex curve.The area between the two
curves is now pi*p^2 = pi*q^2.

Now,  if the new closed curve has a perpendicular section (with itself) ,
i.e. a knot-point, then there is a single point for the wanted square.
Therefore - If it is possible to proof that such a point exists as a
function of p or q, then the problem is proofed (?).

Well -of course the sliding chord would be the side of the wanted square,
i.e. one (or the longest side) of the wanted square is 2*p=2*q or more
simply p+q. (Note that at this point we are searching a square but not
necessarily rectangular square.) The radius of a circle (A), which goes
through the 2 edges or the corners of the wanted square with side 2*p, is
p*squareroot(2).

The centre of a circle (A) is "somewhere" perpendicular to the middle point
of the sliding chord. In other word - the sliding side of the wanted square
is tangent of the new circle (B), which touches the middle point of the
wanted square. Circle (A) and circle (B) has the same centre.

If we now let a circle (B) with radius p=q roll inside the drawn smooth,
closed convex curve (C-2) that was the result as the centre point of the
wanted square traced out, we have the third smooth, closed convex curve
(C-3) for all the centre points of the circle with radius p*squareroot(2)
because it is at the perpendicular distance of radius p from curve (C-2).
Curve (C-3) draws therefore all the centre points of circle (A) and circle
(B).
.
Certainly the circle (A) exists, if p/2 is smaller than the longest diameter
of closed curve C-1, and it touches at least two corners of the wanted
square, i.e. the ends of the sliding chord, which was a side of the wanted
square.  The circle (B) with radius p touches the middle point of the side
of the wanted square, i.e. curve (C-2) with centre on C-3.

Now if the circle (A), with the centre point on curve C-3, cuts the original
smooth, closed convex curve C-1 in 4 points we have found a square, but not
necessarily a rectangular square.
Anyway,  by choosing a certain length or p for the sliding chord, it would
be apparent that the centre of the circle (A) is found and also a kind of
square is found.

Apparently, if circle (A) with radius p*sqrt(2) rolls on the outside of the
smooth convex curve C-3, it is possible to draw a new smooth convex curve
C-4 that is at the radius distance (p*sqrt(2)) from the curve C-3. Iff now
the curves C-1 and C-4 have four common point, a square is found, but not
necessarily a rectangular square. The common points of the curves C-4 and
C-2 may help, but the proof that the solution is a rectangular square is not
so easy.

The above mentioned "story" how to find the centre of the circle (A) is not
a proof. I think it would be hopefully a method to find the proof for some p
and for some curve C-1.
The method and the proof that the wanted square is rectangular square is far
away.

At least - you may received a tip for further studies - hopefully.

Unfortunately, it seems to require some smoothness of the curve, like the 
proofs I already knew about. Here is the review from MathScinet:

7,35c 56.0X

the same title, published in Sbornik Rabot Matematiceskogo Razdela Sekcii 
Estestvennyh i Tocnyh Nauk Komakademii, Moscow, 1929, but with the earlier 
proofs somewhat amplified.] The most striking results of this paper are that 
(1) on every simple closed plane curve possessing a continuous curvature 
there may be found four points constituting the vertices of a square; (2) 
under the same hypotheses there exists on the curve a "full" system of 
rhombuses. A system $S$ of rhombuses $\{R\}$ whose vertices lie on a given 
curve $L$ is called "full" provided that (i) every point of $L$ is a vertex 
of some $R$ of $S$, (ii) each pair $R$ and $R'$ of $S$ belong to a continuous 
one-parameter family in $S$ and this family may be chosen so that an 
arbitrary vertex of $R$ passes over to a preassigned vertex in $R'$, (iii) 
none of the rhombuses is degenerate (that is, none of them is a point or 
doubly covered line-segment).

I can't understand one detail of your proof-sketch at the end of

Specifically:

I am wondering how to embed the annulus so as to meet that condition.

It seems to me that near either annulus boundary, x is very close to y
(with one boundary having x just "before" y on the curve, and the other
boundary having x just "after" y on the curve, where we imagine the
curve as having an arbitrary "before"/"after" orientation).

Therefore, if you swap x and y for some point (a,b) near a boundary, you
must get a point near the other boundary, whereas the opposite point (-a,-b)
would be near the same boundary. Am I missing something?

No, it looks like I am -- the "proof" seems to be buggy.
One reason it can't be right: if true, then (since it doesn't seem to use 
much of the square's actual geometry) it would also show e.g. that there is 
a 60-120 rhomb on any smooth Jordan curve.  But this is not true, for 
instance, when the curve is a circle.

Well this is bludgeon, but it works. Wlog take one point to be the
north pole and the other two points chosen at random (uniformly wrt
to surface area) in the northern hemisphere. The probability se
seek is that of these two points having an angular separation of at
least pi/2. Let theta be the angle from the first point to the
north pole. The probability that the 2nd point has a distance pi/2
from the first is proportional to the area of the intersection of
the northern hemisphere with the hemisphere opposite the 1st point
which is  2R^2 theta. The probability is of this thus theta/pi. Hence
the probability we seek is integral theta/pi dS over the northern
hemisphere divided by its area. Using spherical polars this is
(1/pi) int_0^{pi/2} theta sin theta d theta = 1/pi.

Is there a theory explaining the symmetry groups a polyhedron-with-holes
(or other surface imbedded or immersed in R^3) is allowed to have?
I mean symmetries derived from rotations or isometries of R^3, not
diffeomorphisms etc.

For instance, with tetrahedral symmetry I can make a surface with
genus 3A+8B, for any A and B, by starting from a regular tetrahedron
and performing A alternations of drilling four holes meeting in the
center or building four handles meeting at the center, and by repeating
B times making a Y-shaped hole near each of the four vertices.

So, this only leaves out genus 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 13.  Are any of
these possible?  I can also immerse a genus-four manifold with
tetrahedral symmetry (imagine holes running from each vertex of a
tetrahedron to the opposite face) and this also leads to immersions of
genus 7, 10, 13 but not 1, 2, or 5.

You might have more luck in higher dimensions. For example,
the torus S1 x S1 sits in complex 2-dimensional space and
has a two dimensional group of symmetries. You can also
embed the torus in various ways in complex projective spaces
of dimensions 2,3,4,... as the "elliptic normal curve"
so as to be invariant under a group of order 2*n^2, n-1  being
the dimension of the projective space. You can probably easily
get a triangulation invariant under that group.

As an addendum to my earlier message, tetrahedrally symmetric polyhedra
can also achieve genus 5: drill holes from the middle of each edge,
meeting in the center.  Combining this with the other operations also
gives genus 13.  7 is possible by drilling holes from the vertices and faces,
all meeting together at the center. I still don't know how to do 1, 2, and 10.

them and not all on the same line.  If d(A,Q) (=distance from A to Q)
and d(B,Q) are both integers, note that d(A,Q) - d(B,Q) is one of the
integers from -d(A,B) to d(A,B).  Now for any given k, the points Q
with d(A,Q) - d(B,Q) = k lie on a branch of a hyperbola (or its degenerate
cases, a straight line parallel or perpendicular to AB).  Every point of
your set is an intersection of one of these curves, and one of the 
analogous curves for A and C, and one of the curves for B and C.  But
any two of the curves intersect in only a finite number of points.  
Therefore there are only a finite number of points with integer distances
from A, B and C.

That's easy: 3.  Namely, the vertices of an equilateral triangle of
side 1 form a non-extendable set.  

Proof: if A and B are two of the vertices, and Q any point with integer
distances from both but not collinear with them, then the absolute 
value of the difference between the distances AQ and BQ is less than 1,
so must be 0.  The only point equidistant from all three vertices is
the centroid, but this is not an integer distance from them.

This is a tough one. Let a_1 = n, b_1 = n-1, then r(n, 1) is,
by the mean value theorem

sqrt{n} - sqrt{n-1} = 1/(2 sqrt{xi}),   n-1 < xi < n

                    < 1/(2 sqrt{n-1})

so I would conjecture that liminf r(n,k) = 0.

Do I get to be co-author or what? (This is one of the dangers of 
posting your technical lemmas as problems to the net.)

Andrew Odlyzko and Michael Ben-Or both informed me that this is a
known difficult problem.  Its decade-old origins are not clear (to me),
but at the least Ron Graham has discussed it in public lectures.
The consensus seems to be that the only bounds known are something
like n^{-2^k}, or perhaps (n*k)^{-2^k}, or perhaps (4*n*k)^{-4^k},
but in any case n^{-p} with p exponential in k.  On the other hand,
Odlyzko feels that the true bound is more like n^{-k}, or perhaps
n^{-2*k}: n^{-p} with p linear in k.  The gap between what can be
proved and what seems to be true, is rather wide, but closing
it seems difficult.

Thanks for the pointer to your page on equal sums of like powers,
http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/chenhome.htm

You know, by the way, of the following application of such sums?

It is an important open problem in computational geometry how much
precision is needed to compute lengths of polygonal paths, in order to
determine which of two paths is longer.  If the path vertices have
integer coordinates, each length is a sum of square roots of integers,
so the problem can be expressed in number-theoretic terms: how small can
be a nonzero number that is the sum of k terms +-sqrt(a_i) where each
a_i is an integer smaller than some bound N.

The known lower bounds are something like N^{-2^k}, but the best known
upper bound (i.e. explicit construction) is much larger, something like
N^{-k}.  This upper bound is based on sums like the ones you treat.
(I think this may be due to Ron Graham but unfortunately I can't find
the reference offhand -- Marshall Bern showed it to me and Graham
may have showed it to him.)  Here's how it works:

Suppose we have two sets of numbers a_i and b_i,
such that sum(a_i^j - b_i^j)=0 for all j from 0 to k.
(You have a page http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/TarryPrb.htm
on this case.)  For instance, your home page has
a_i={1,19,20,51,57,80,82}, b_i={2,12,31,40,69,71,85}, k=6.

Then, consider the number
	x = sum(sqrt(N - a_i) - sqrt(N - b_i)).

Each of the summands sqrt(N - a_i) can be expressed as a Taylor series
sqrt(N)*(1-y^2-y^2/8-y^3/16-5y^4/128-7y^5/256-...)
where y=a_i/N.  The fact that all the sums of powers of ai and bi
are equal means that the initial terms in these Taylor series cancel
and x = O(sqrt(n) y^{k+1}) = O(N^{-k-1/2}).

Numerically, with the a_i above and N=1000, we have x ~= 2.5 * 10^{-11}.
With N=10000 we have x ~= 6 * 10^{-18}, and in general multiplying N by
10 is going to lead to a reduction by around 3*10^6 in x.  With more of
the sums of powers being equal, x would go down even more quickly as a
function of N.  So, solutions to the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem lead
to quite small sums of square roots.

Subject:        Jordan Sorting with Splay Trees conjecture
Date:           12 Aug 1995 13:40:08 -0400
Organization:   The Johns Hopkins University CS Department

Jordan Sorting is the problem of sorting a list of numbers by
x-coordinate, assuming that the numbers represent intersections of a
non-self-intersecting (i.e. Jordan) curve with the x-axis, and that
they are given in the order that they appear along this curve.  It has
been known for about a decade (as far as I my research has determined)
that Jordan Sorting can be performed in linear time.

What I'm curious about is the following conjecture given in a
paper that presents a linear time algorithm (reference given below):

    Our second remark is that there may be a much simpler way
    to sort Jordan sequences in linear time: we merely insert
    the items in the sequence one-at-a-time into a splay tree 
    ... and then access them in sorted order.  ... On the basis
    of Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic optimality conjecture, we 
    conjecture than this sorts Jordan sequences in O(n) time.

This is from "Sorting Jordan Sequences in Linear Time Using
Level-Linked Search Trees" (Hoffman, Mehlhorn, Rosensteihl, and
Tarjan, _Information and Control_ 68 (1986) pp.170--184).

Several later papers claim to present simpler algorithms, but the
most recent one I've seen (1990) is still not nearly as simple
as the approach using splay trees.  So, I'm curious if this
conjecture has been treated either theoretically or experimentally.

From a theoretical perspective, one would think that if the conjecture
is true, it would at least be easier to prove than the dynamic
optimality conjecture, and would still be a pretty interesting result.

It strikes me as even more attractive as an experimental issue,
though, because there is existing code for splay trees, and random
Jordan sequences are not hard to generate (of course, this leaves open
the issue of generating "hard" cases of Jordan Sorting).  In a sense,
there's no excuse at all for not performing this experiment.  My
literature search was far from exhaustive, so if there are
experimental results, I'd very much appreciate a reference.

It seems to me that if the conjecture is actually true, then one could
perhaps make a careful study of the splay tree algorithm for Jordan
Sorting and try to infer what it is doing to achieve such good
results.  This would provide a non-trivial linear time algorithm that
in some sense "exists in nature" rather than being the consequence of
clever design.  If true, that strikes me (and some other people, I
hope) as quite remarkable despite the fact that it would do no better
than a known optimal algorithm.

Subject:        A family of Jordan Sequences for which Splay Sort is Omega(n log n)
Date:           25 Sep 1995 14:13:09 -0400
Organization:   The Johns Hopkins University CS Department

About a month and a half ago, I posted an inquiry about a conjecture
related to sorting Jordan sequences.  A Jordan sequence is a list of
intersections of a non-self-intersecting plane curve with the x-axis.
The Jordan sequence sorting problem is to sort these intersections by
x coordinate.  The non-crossing-curve restriction implies that the
number of Jordan sequences of n values is O(c^n) for some c, rather
than n!, implying that a general-purpose comparison-based sorting
algorithm may not be optimal. In fact has been known for over a decade
that Jordan sequences can be sorted in O(n) time using only
comparisons (I emphasize the point about comparisons to avoid getting
mired in the MSD-radix-sort flame war now in progress).

Anyway, there is an appealing conjecture in two of the papers
presenting linear time algorithms (Information and Control, 68 170-184
(1986) and Information Processing Letters 35 85-92 (1990)) that if the
values in a Jordan Sequence are simply inserted into a splay tree, and
read off in sorted order, then this might also require O(n) time in
the worst case.  This general technique is usually called Splay Sort,
and can for certain kinds of input be shown to require much less time
than a worst-case optimal comparision-based sort such as Mergesort.
If I understand the Jordan Sequence conjecture correctly, I can show that it is
incorrect.  

I don't know if the following result is new, but it's fairly
specialized and doesn't seem to lead anywhere, so I'm posting it here
after wondering for about a month what to do with it.  Because this posting
not a formal publication, I'm going to leave out some steps.  It
should not be too hard to fill in the details.  

First, to prove a lower bound on sorting a sequence using Splay Sort,
it will suffice to prove a lower bound for any algorithm that uses
insertions into a binary search tree using any rotation strategy.  In
fact, the more general kind of lower bound is often easier to prove
than a lower bound for Splay Sort itself, owing to the work of Robert
Wilber in FOCS '86 (revised version in Siam J Comp vol. 18 no. 1),
which provides two powerful methods for showing lower bounds on
accessing sequences of values in Binary Search Trees.  We will not
really need these methods here, but only the corollary that accessing
the nodes of a binary tree containing the values 0,1,...,2^k-1 in
bit-reversed order (i.e. taking the binary representations of these
values in increasing order but reversing the "significance" of the
bits) requires Omega(k 2^k) rotations

In the following, I'm going to use the claim that sorting a sequence by
inserting it into a binary tree is as hard as accessing the same
sequence in a tree containing these values.  I haven't proved this,
but it seems to me that each time a value is inserted (a new leaf
added at what was a "null pointer"), one could imagine that that value
already existed as a node in the tree but had not previously been
accessed.  It should thus be possible to construct an initial tree
containing the values to be sorted for which the rotation sequence is
the same whether one is inserting into an intially empty tree, or
accessing from an initally full tree.  (Originally, I had a more
complicated idea for a proof that would not require this claim
but I think it is true, and it results in a cleaner argument).

Now, what remains is simply to construct a family of "hard" Jordan
Sequences such that for any value of n there is a sequence in this
family containing at least n elements.  As it happens, the sequences
in this family will bear a relationship to bit-reversed order that
will cause them to require Omega(n log n) rotations to sort using any
binary search tree, according to the result of Wilber.

First I'll give an intuitive explanation of where these sequences come
from.  If one were to take a looped, flattened out strip of paper and
view it facing the edge, this would look like a very simple Jordan
Curve.  I.e.:

             +---------------------------------------+
             |                                       |
             +---------------------------------------+

(unfortunately, ASCII graphics make it unclear, so let me repeat that
this is viewed on edge, not from above, as it might also appear).

If this is folded over on itself to double its thickness, we
get another Jordan Curve, but which is somewhat more convoluted.

       I.e:

            +-------------------+
            |                   |
            +---------------+   |
                            |   |
            +---------------+   |
            |                   |
            +-------------------+

We can repeat this "doubling over" process as many times as we like,
each time doubling the number of intersections of the curve with
a vertical line.  For larger examples, it becomes more convenient to
represent the shape of the curve using two sets of matching
parentheses (this is the representation normally used to prove a bound on the
number of Jordan Sequences).  E.g., if we double over two more times,
and rotate 90 degrees so the curve intersects the x-axis, we obtain:

            (((((((())))))))
            ()()(())(((())))

Matching parentheses in the top sequence with arcs above and those in
the bottom sequence with arcs below gives us the actual curve.

To connect this idea with bit-reversed order, we will describe the
folding process as a transformation on a sequence of numbers that will
denote the actual Jordan Sequence in question.  The correspondence to
folding is not too hard to see, but will be omitted here, since it
is not really needed once we obtain the final form of the construction.

First, in the original loop, the sequence of intersections is the same
both on the curve and on the intersecting line, so we denote this
sequence 0 1.

Now, given such a sequence, we obtain the next, doubled over, sequence
as follows:

    (1) double each number in the sequence
    (2) append the new sequence to its own reverse
    (3) Add 1 to every odd-positioned number in the sequence
        (the leftmost position is considered even).

E.g.

     0 1   -->    0 2        by (1)
           -->    0 2 2 0    by (2)
           -->    0 3 2 1    by (3)

     0 3 2 1  -->  0 6 4 2   
              -->  0 6 4 2 2 4 6 0
              -->  0 7 4 3 2 5 6 1

     0 7 4 3 2 5 6 1  -->  0 14 8 6 4 10 12 2
                      -->  0 14 8 6 4 10 12 2 2 12 10 4 6 8 14 0
                      -->  0 15 8 7 4 11 12 3 2 13 10 5 6 9 14 1

     etc.

Here I'll resort to "proof by example" and simply point out that
if you take the increasing sequence:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

and connect pairs of numbers adjacent in the sequence obtained in the
process above with non-crossing arcs (also connecting the end values
0 and 1) you will obtain the Jordan Curve determined by the set of 
matching parentheses given earlier.

Recall that for the lower bound, we want to connect this in some way
to bit reversed order.  So, yet another way to obtain the above
sequence is to define the following function f on k-bit binary numbers
denoted B = b    ... b
             k-1      0

In the following, assume "+" denotes exclusive-or, and let

            f(b   ... b )  = (b + b ) (b + b) ... (b   +b ) b0
               k-1     0       1   0    2   0       k-1  0

In other words, reverse the order of bits 1 through k-1, keeping b
                                                                  0

in the same position.  Also, if b  = 1, then invert bits 1 through k-1.
                              0

E.g.,

       B     f(B)
      ---    ---
      000    000
      001    111   
      010    100
      011    011
      100    010
      101    101
      110    110
      111    001

Now, to get the kth sequence determined by the process given
previously, we merely take the values i = 0,...,2^k-1 expressed in
binary, and apply the function f to each i in increasing order.  (We
overload the meaning of f(i) to denote the result of converting i to a
binary string, applying f, and converting it back to an integer.)  It
can be seen that from the above table, the sequence for k=3 is 
0 7 4 3 2 5 6 1, which corresponds to that obtained previously.

I imagine a lot of readers on this newsgroup don't find examples very
convincing, no matter how large they are and how nicely they work out.
Fortunately, once the function f has been defined as above, it
suffices to show only that the sequence f(0), f(1), ..., f(2^k-1) is a
Jordan Sequence, which is an easier task than showing it corresponds
to the particular Jordan sequences illustrated earlier.

To do this, it is necessary to show that if the numbers 0,1,...,2^k-1
are written in order left to right, then adjacent numbers in the sequence
f(0),f(1), ..., f(2^k-1) can be connected by non-crossing arcs alternating
above and below the list of numbers.

A key observation needed for such a proof is that two arcs, one from 
a to b, and another from c to d cannot cross so long as a+b = c+d.  The
other is that they cannot cross if a < b < c < d.  The set of arcs
from a to b can be put in k+1 equivalence classes according to a+b, so
that there is no crossing within each equivalence class.  The second
observation can then be used to exclude crossings between arcs in
distinct equivalence classes.

So, if I were writing a more rigorous article, it would now say something like
"Lemma: For all k>0, the sequence f(0),f(1),...,f(2^k-1) is a
Jordan Sequence."  This would be followed by a proof, which is here
left as an exercise.

What remains is to show that it requires Omega(k 2^k) comparisons to
sort such a sequence using Splay Sort.  This can be seen by
considering only those f(i) such that i is even.  Let R(i) denote the
result of reversing the order of the bits in the binary representation
of i.  By definition of f, we know that for even values of i,
f(i)=2*R(i/2), so the subsequence f(0), f(2), ..., f(2^k-2) must be in
bit-reversed order.  Since the sequence f(0),f(1),...,f(2^k-1)
contains 2^(k-1) elements in bit-reversed order, the result of Wilber
implies that the time to access such a sequence in a binary search
tree is Omega((k-1)2^(k-1)), and this also provides a bound on the time
to sort the sequence using Splay Sort.

Then, it follows that there exists a c such that for any value of n,
one can construct a Jordan Sequence of length greater than n that
requires c n log n comparisons to sort using Splay Sort, refuting the
conjecture (as I understood it) that Splay Sort is a linear time
algorithm for sorting Jordan Sequences.

This is the crux of the matter -- can the lower bound in [1] be used to
get an an Omega(n log n) lower bound on Jordan sorting via insertion into
a symmetrically ordered binary tree?  That lower bound assumed that all
elements are in the tree at the start, that they are being accessed in some
specified order (allowing rotations in the tree), and that no insertions or
deletions are done.

>(Originally, I had a more
>complicated idea for a proof that would not require this claim

I believe your claim is false.  But I think the lower bound can be patched
up to work for this case.

Consider how Jordan sorting with a binary tree proceeds:

First, we traverse the simple closed curve, each time we encounter an 
intersection with the x axis, we insert that intersection point into a binary
tree that is symmetrically ordered by the x coordinate.

Second, we access the items in the tree, in order by x coordinate.

At the end of the first pass the items are sorted by x coordinate, so the
second pass accesses the nodes in sequential order.  This pass takes linear
time, including when the splay algorithm is used to do the accessing, as was
proved by Tarjan [2].

So any lower bound must be applied to the first pass, when the items are
being inserted.  I find it convenient to "reverse the film" -- items are
inserted into a tree in sequential order by x coordinate, in linear time,
and then they are deleted in the order they appear on the curve (that is,
deleted according to a Jordan sequence).  We want to show that the deletion
phase takes n log n time.

We need to extend the model to allow for deletions.  I think the following
definition covers all the cases:

Definition:  A *standard deletion* of a node v can occur when v has at most
one child.  In that case, if v has no children (it is a leaf) it is simply
removed.  Otherwise v is removed and v's only child is made a child of v's
parent (if v was not the root) or is made the root (if v was the root).

In general, to delete a node v you do some sequence of rotations so that
v has at most one child, and then you do a standard deletion of v.

For example, as I recall deletion of a node v in a splay tree proceeds as
follows:

1.  v is splayed to the root and removed, leaving its left and right subtrees,
    L and R.

2.  The largest node in L, r, is splayed to the root of L.

3.  R is made the right subtree of r.

This can be cast into the "standard model" as follows:

1.  v is splayed to the root.  Its left subtree is L.

2.  The largest node in L, r, is splayed to the root of L, making r the left
    child of v.

3.  r is rotated over v.

4.  v has no left child; a standard deletion of v is done.

Clearly this has the same complexity as the usual deletion routine.

In the model when we delete v we must also count the cost of accessing v from
the root.  In order to fold all the costs into rotations, we require that the
algorithm be "normalized" so that before deleting any node it first rotates
that node to the root.  This can always be done without increasing the
time by more than a constant factor, because if the original algorithm does
a standard deletion of some node v at depth d, it could first rotatate v to
the root, then rotate v back to where it was (using 2d - 2 rotations), and
then delete v.  The cost of the extra rotations is just a constant times the
cost of following the path from the root to v.  Likewise a look up of v is
always done by rotating v to the root.

Two lower bound methods were given in [1], I will only patch up the first one
(both methods give an Omega(n log n) bound for accessing the bit reversal
permutation).

It is important to understand that the intuition behind both lower bounds is
that items you access "get in the way" of items that you want to access later,
and must be rotated over.  But if you can delete nodes, you can sometimes get a
node v out of the way by deleting it, which might be cheaper than forcing
several nodes "underneath" to rotate over v.  So the ability to shrink the
tree as you go might invalidate the lower bounds given in [1].

Here's a very quick review of the first lower bound method.  We have some
binary search tree T, whose n nodes may be considered to be consecutive
integers.  We allow rotations and standard deletions on T.  A lower bound tree
Y with 2n - 1 nodes is constructed whose leaves are the initial nodes of T and 
whose internal nodes lie between nodes in T, that is, they may be taken to be 
half integers.  T changes through rotations and deletions but Y is fixed.  For
getting the lower bound on the bit reversal permutation Y is taken to be a
balanced binary tree.  The sequence of nodes in T to be accessed is s[1], s[2],
..., s[m].  (A node is "accessed" if we either look it up or delete it; in both
cases such a node must be rotated to the root in a normalized algorithm.)
Given numbers x < y, s{x, y} is the subsequence consisting of those s[i]s that
are in the interval [x, y].  For each internal node u of Y, a score l(u) is
computed as follows: Let x and y be the minimum and maximum leaves of the
subtree rooted at u, and let s' = s{x, y} and let m' be the length of s'.  Then

l(u) = |{ i in [1, m'] | (s'(i) < u and s'(i+1) > u) or
                         (s'(i) > u and s'(i+1) < u) }|.

That is, l(u) counts how many times the subsequence s' hops from the left
subtree of u to the right subtree, or vice versa.

The sum of the l(u)'s is a lower bound on the number of rotations that must
be done to access sequence s, if no deletions are done.

A key part of the argument is that if s(i) < u and s(i+1) > u, then at some
point between the access of s(i) and the access of s(i+1) there had to be a
rotation of some node c > u over some node d < u.  Furthermore, such a rotation
has no affect on the generalized subtrees T{x, u} and T{u, y} corresponding to
the leaves of u's left and right subtrees, so it is not already counted in
the scores of u's children.  (See [1] for the definition of a generalized
subtree.)

But suppose now that we allow standard deletions.  If, for example, s(i) is at
the root, has s(i+1) as its right child, and has no left child, then after
accessing s(i) we can access s(i+1) simply by deleting s(i).  No rotations had
to be done at all.  One might try to fix this by counting deletions of nodes in
[x, y] in the score l(u), but this doesn't work because such such deletions
would be doubled counted in some of u's children.  In other words, either
T{x, u} or T{u, y} is affected by any deletion of a node in [x, y].

To fix the lower bound note that if there is some j > i such that s(j) < s(i),
then even if s(i) is deleted it has to be the case that between the access of
s(i) < u and the access of s(i+1) > u there's going to be a rotation of a node
c > u over a node d < u.  (Use the first rotation after the access of s(i) that
causes s(j) to have an ancestor that is > u; no standard deletion can cause
this to happen.)

Given sequence s of length m, say that i in [1, m] is an *end access* for s
if either s(j) > s(i) for all j in [i+1, m] or else s(j) < s(i) for all
j in [i+1, m].  That is, i is not an end access if for some j1, j2 > i,
s(j1) < s(i) and s(j2) > s(i).  Intuitively, end accesses are the nodes we
can get out of the way by deletion.

Modify the score for u as follows:

l'(u) =  |{ i in [1, m] | ((s'(i) < u and s'(i+1) > u) or
                           (s'(i) > u and s'(i+1) < u)) and
                          i is not an end access in subsequence s'}|.

Now the lower bound goes through, using l'(u) rather than l(u), because we
only count a rotation for u when s(i) < u and s(i+1) > u, and there is some
j > i with s(j) < u.  (Or else s(i) > u and s(i+1) < u, and there is some
j > i with s(j) > u.)

For the bit reversal permutation it is convenient to index the sequence from
0, so that s(i) = bit_reversal(i).  For a bit reversal sequence on k bits,
it is easy to show that there are only k+1 end accesses.  These are at those
                        j
elements s(i) equal to 2  - 1, for some j in [0, k].  So the score assigned
to a node u at the j'th level of the lower bound tree, whose subsequence is a
bit reversal permutation on j bits, is
         j
l'(u) = 2  - 1 - (j + 1).

                         k-j
The j'th level of Y has 2    nodes, so summing all the scores we get
      __
      \   k-j     j                    k
L  =  /_ 2    * (2  - j - 2)  = (k-4)*2  + k + 4.
  1 < j < k

          k
With n = 2 ,  this gives an Omega(n log n) lower bound.

So any algorithm that sorts a Jordan sequence by inserting the elements into
a binary tree, maintained via rotations, requires n log n time.

Note that at any single internal node u of the the lower bound tree the
subtracting out of the end accesses can cause a radical reduction in u's score.
For example, if the subsequence for u = 10.5 is
    1 20 2 19 3 18 4 17 5 16 6 15 7 14 8 13 9 12 10 11
then l(u) = 19 but l'(u) = 0.

Indeed, if the nodes are in the following "zig-zag" binary tree

     1
      \
       20
      /
     2
      \
       19
      /
     3
      \
       ...

They can be accessed in the stated order solely through standard deletions,
with no rotations.

Question:  Are there sequences of n nodes where the lower bound for accessing
with deletions is d(n) and the lower bound for accessing without deletions is
not O(d(n) + n)?  Such a sequence will need many end accesses in many of its
subsequences.

There is a statement I made in my last post that needs some correction and
clarification.

and I said
>I believe your claim is false...

It is clear that the model of insertion that Callahan had in mind is that nodes
are always inserted as leaves in the appropriate part of the tree.  It that
case his claim is easily proven to be true.  Starting from an empty tree, carry
out a sequence of rotations and insertions of new leaves until all nodes have
been inserted, creating some tree T.  Now carry out the sequence backward,
starting from T, except that when you would delete a leaf (the backwards
version of inserting it), instead leave the node in place and mark it as
deleted.  Subsequent rotations in the backwards sequence do not involve any
marked leaves.  Furthermore, leaves marked as deleted stay at the fringe of the
tree, that is, it is never the case that a marked leaf has an unmarked leaf as
a child.  So the backward sequence of rotations can be carried out.  In the 
final tree all nodes are marked.  This is the tree that satisfies the claim.

What I had in mind was a more general model of insertion, namely, the reverse
of "standard deletions", and it is with this more general type of insertion
that the claim appears to be false.  A standard insertion of a node v into a
tree T is defined as follows:

1.  Let x be the largest node < v in T, and let y be the smallest node > v in
    T.  (For now assume that v is neither smaller than every node in T, nor
    bigger than every node in T.)

2.  Either x is an ancestor of y or y is an ancestor of x.  Assume the former.
    Let u[0] = x, u[1], u[2], ..., u[k] = y be the path from x to y.  u[1] is
    the right child of x and for i > 1, u[i] is the left child of u[i-1].
    Node v can be made a child of any one of the u[i]s.  If it is made a child
    of x, it is a right child, otherwise it is a left child.  v has no left
    child and is given u[i+1] as a right child (unless i = k, in which case
    v is a leaf).

3.  If v is less than every node in T, we can either make v the root (with T as
    its right subtree) or can insert v as a left child of any of the nodes
    along the leftmost path of T.  Similarly when v is greater than every node
    in T.

4.  The cost of a standard insertion is the cost of following the path from
    the root to v after v is inserted.

Note that the argument used above to prove Callahan's claim for insertions of
leaves doesn't work for the more general type of insertion, because marked
nodes might be left in the middle of the tree (with unmarked nodes as children)
and this can make subsequent rotations in the reverse sequence invalid.

It is trivial to emulate a splay tree insertion by means of rotations and a
standard insertion, with no change in the cost of the operation.  I don't
see any way to emulate a splay tree insertion with rotations and an insertion
of a leaf, while retaining the original cost.

So the "patched up" lower bound of my previous post seems to be necessary to be
able to claim that a splay sort of a bit reversal permutation, or of a Jordan
sequence, requires n log n time.

OK, this is a point I hadn't considered, so I guess things are a bit
more complicated than I had hoped.  As I mentioned, I had a backup
argument.  This relied on a different claim that seemed clear at the
time, namely that to insert an element into a binary tree, one must
access either its successor or predecessor in symmetric order.

Now that you bring up the issue of general insertions, even the latter
claim seems less clear to me, because it is only true in the
case of leaf insertions that one must link the node directly to
either its successor or predecessor.  However, it should still hold
because one cannot certify that a node is being inserted into the
correct place without having seen its successor and predecessor (at least
assuming no extra information is maintained in the tree).

Anyway, instead of bounding the rotations from the very beginning, we
can simply ignore the cost of inserting the first half of the
bit-reversed sequence (even-valued elements).  Then, to bound the cost
of inserting the remaining (odd-valued) elements, we would find the
cost of accessing any sequence of successors or predecessors of these
elements (which I think should be Omega(n log n)).  Since the above
poster seems to have patched up my argument to his own satisfaction,
there is probably no need for this (especially if the correspondence
between his name and the author of one of the cited papers is not
coincidental.)

Actually, this brings up another unstated assumption I would have to
use, which is that the cost of accessing *any* subsequence of n/2
elements from a list of n elements in bit-reversed order is 
Omega(n log n).  I would be surprised if this were not true, but I don't know
the best way of proving it.  Clearly, there are some sequences that
are "hard" to access but which contain an "easy" subsequence of length
n/2, but intuitively it looks like any subsequence of a bit-reversed
permutation should have the same property of breaking down the kind of
locality of reference needed to obtain o(n log n) rotations.  I'd
appreciate any insight into this.  I suspect that the machinery
needed for the lower bound on bit-reversed sequences would be sufficient,
but maybe there is a simpler argument.

Well, this brings up an issue that arises with any sort of lower bound --
what's the right model?  When inserting node v in a tree that contains
immediate predecessor x and immediate successor y, it is arguable that one
should charge for the cost of finding both x and y, in order to certify that v
is being inserted in a legal spot (let's call these two nodes bounds(v)).
Instead, for standard insertions I charge the cost of following the path from
the root to the newly inserted node.  My reasons for choosing the cost model I
did are as follows:

1.  Symmetry.  The cost of a standard insertion is the same as the cost of a
standard deletion of the same node in the time reversed sequence.  It is clear
that when deleting node v it is not necessary to charge for finding bounds(v).

2.  Generality.  This is a more generous cost model than the one that charges
for finding bounds(v), so any lower bound obtained with this cost model will
apply to a broader class of algorithms.  In principle, an algorithm doesn't
need to look for bounds(v).  For example, store the minimum and maximum
values in the entire tree, and in addition, store with each non-root node
v the minimum value of the subtree it is a root of, if v is a right child of
its parent, or the maximum value of the subtree it is a root of, if v is a
left child of its parent.  With these values we can verify the validity of an
insertion while only having to look as far as the child of the node being
inserted.  These values can be maintained in constant time under rotations.
For example, if x is a left child of z and y is a right child of x, then when
x is rotated over z, x gets z's old extremum value (either a minimum or a 
maximum), z gets y's old minimum, and y gets x's old maximum.  When a standard
deletion or insertion is done, the cost of making the required updates of
extrema can be charged against the cost of following the path from the root to
the inserted or deleted node.

Most balanced search tree algorithms need *some* sort of extra information in
the tree.  For example, red-black trees need a bit per node that tells whether
they're red or black (splay trees are unusual in that they don't have any such
extra information).  So, while storing one extra value in each node is more
overhead than some other search algorithms have, it seems arbitrary to reject
out of hand algorithms that do that.  And there might be a less costly way to
avoid looking at bounds(v).

3.  Simplicity.  If I charge for finding bounds(v), I have to figure out what
bounds(v) is.  For a highly regular sequence like the bit reversal permutation
this is easy, but in general it might be harder than counting end accesses.

Well, yes, if for inserting each node v you charge for accessing bounds(v)
I believe this works.  For the second half of the bit reversal permutation,
br(n/2), br(n/2 + 1), ..., br(n-1), the nodes accessed are
bounds(br(n/2)), bounds(br(n/2 + 1)), ..., bounds(br(n-1)), from which we can
extract the subsequence br(0), br(1), ..., br(n/2 - 1).  And this takes
Omega(n log n) time to access.  A complicating factor is that as you proceed,
nodes are being inserted into the tree (you're not just doing accesses) but
I don't think this affects the validity of the lower bound proofs.  This is
sufficient to establish a bound on splay sorting, since a splay insertion of v
does in fact access bounds(v).

I thought this was self evident.  Suppose I can access some sequence s[1],
s[2], ..., s[n] in time f(n).  Then the same algorithm also accesses any
subsequence, s[i_1], s[i_2], ..., s[i_k] in time f(n).  (Just ignore the
accesses you don't care about.)  So any lower bound on accessing the
subsequence is necessarily a lower bound on accessing the full sequence.

Actually, I meant that the bound should also hold in the other
direction for bit-reversed sequences.  What I want to show is that the
lower bound for the full bit-reversed sequence is (to within a
constant) a lower bound for any subsequence containing half the
elements.

There are sequences for which this doesn't hold.  For example, interleave
a bit-reversed sequence with a sequence in increasing order.  Then
the full sequence requires Omega(n log n) rotations for access, but
it contains a subsequence (the one in increasing order) that requires
O(n) rotations.  But what I'm claiming is that the bit-reversed
sequence does not contain any such "easy" sequence as a subsequence.

Is this true?

I suspect that it is, but I don't have a proof.

However, you don't need such a strong claim for your proof to work.  Let's look
at it again.  We have a proof that accessing a bit reversal permutation of
length n via a binary search tree algorithm requires c * n log n time,
for some c > 0.

We insert into an initially empty tree a bit reversal permutation on k bits,
          k
with n = 2  elements.  We want to show that inserting the last n/2 elements
requires accessing the n/2 nodes already in tree in bit reversal order.  Fix k
at 4.  When br(n/2) = 0001 is inserted, we must access the lower of
bounds(0001), namely, the lower of 0000 and 0010.  The higher of these
two nodes is an ancestor of the lower, so we actually visit both and are free
to charge for accessing either one.  So charge for acessing 0000.  When we
insert br(n/2 + 1) = 1001, we must access 1000 and 1010.  Charge for 1000.
When we insert br(n/2 + 1) = 0101, we must access 0100 and 0110.  Charge for
0100.  The sequence of accesses we charge for, 0000, 1000, 0100, 1100, ....,
1110, is a full bit reversal permutation on k-1 bits (the k'th bit being fixed
at 0), with no missing elements.  So this takes c*(n/2) log (n/2) =
Omega(n log n) time.

The only lower bound being applied here is to a complete bit reversal
permutation, not some arbitrary subsequence of a bit reversal permutation.

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

Origami

The Japanese art of paper folding is obviously geometrical in nature.
Some origami masters have looked at constructing geometric figures such
as regular polyhedra from paper.  In the other direction, some people have
begun using computers to help fold more traditional origami
designs.  This idea works best for tree-like structures, which can be
formed by laying out the tree onto a paper square so that the vertices
are well separated from each other, allowing room to fold up the
remaining paper away from the tree.  Bern and Hayes (SODA 1996) asked,
given a pattern of creases on a square piece of paper, whether one can
find a way of folding the paper along those creases to form a flat
origami shape; they showed this to be NP-complete.  Related theoretical
questions include how many different ways a given pattern of creases
can be folded, whether folding a flat polygon from a square always
decreases the perimeter, and whether it is always possible to fold a
square piece of paper so that it forms (a small copy of) a given flat
polygon.

##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Covering and Packing

Circular
coverage constants.  How big must N equal disks be in order to
completely cover the unit disk?  What about disks with sizes in
geometric progression? From MathSoft's favorite constants pages.



Covering points by rectangles.
Stan Shebs discusses the problem of finding a minimum number of
copies of a given rectangle that will cover all points in some set,
and mentions an application to a computer strategy game.
This is NP-hard, but I don't know how easy it is to approximate;
most related work I know of is on optimizing the rectangle size for a cover
by a fixed number of rectangles.

Equilateral
triangles.  Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a
square torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles
in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; my answer
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, shown below.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see Fáry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.



Erich's
Packing Page. Erich Friedman enjoys packing geometric shapes into
other geometric shapes.

Filling space with unit circles.  Daniel
Asimov asks what fraction of 3-dimensional space can be filled by a
collection of disjoint unit circles.  (It may not be obvious that this
fraction is nonzero, but a standard construction allows one to construct
a solid torus out of circles, and one can then pack tori to fill space,
leaving some uncovered gaps between the tori.)  The geometry center has
information in several places on this problem, the best being an
article
describing a way of filling space by unit circles (discontinuously).

Hales,
Honeybees, and Hexagons.  Thomas Hales proves the optimality of
bees' hexagonal honeycomb structure.  Ivars Peterson, Science News Online.

Hyperbolic packing of convex bodies.
William Thurston answers a question of
Greg Kuperberg, on
whether there is a constant C such that every convex body in the
hyperbolic plane can be packed with density C.  The answer is no -- long
skinny bodies can not be packed efficiently.

Kelvin conjecture counterexample.
Evelyn Sander forwards news about the discovery by Phelan and Weaire
of a better way to partition space
into equal-volume low-surface-area cells.
Kelvin had conjectured that the truncated octahedron provided the optimal
solution, but this turned out not to be true.
See also Ruggero Gabbrielli's comparison of equal-volume partitions and
JavaView
foam models.



Packing Ferrers Shapes.
Alon, Bóna, and Spencer show that one can't cover very much of an n by p(n)
rectangle with staircase polyominoes (where p(n) is the number of these
shapes).

Packing
polyominoes.
Mark Michell investigates the problem of arranging pentominoes into
rectangles of various (non-integer) aspect ratios,
in order to saw the largest possible pieces from a given size piece of
wood.

Packing rectangles into similar rectangles.
A problem of the month from Erich Friedman's Math Magic site:
how small an aspect-ratio-r rectangle can contain n unit-area
aspect-ratio-r rectangles?
As you might hope for in a problem dealing with aspect ratios
of rectangles, the golden rectangle does show up, as one of the
breakpoints in the size function for packing five smaller rectangles.

The Geometry Junkyard: Combinatorial Geometry
##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Combinatorial Geometry

This is a difficult topic to define precisely
without including all of discrete and computational geometry.
What I mean by "combinatorial geometry" consists of
problems in which one starts with a geometric figure
(say a polytope) but then considers abstract
incidence properties
of it rather than its metric properties.
Most tiling
and coloring problems fit into this class,
but since they have their own sections of the junkyard, I omit them here.

Colinear points on knots.
Greg Kuperberg
shows that a non-trivial knot or link in R3
necessarily has four colinear points.

A Counterexample to Borsuk's Conjecture, J. Kahn and G. Kalai,
Bull. AMS 29 (1993).  Partitioning certain high-dimensional polytopes
into pieces with smaller diameter requires a number of pieces
exponential in the dimension.

Delaunay triangulation and points of
intersection of lines. Tom McGlynn asks whether the DT of a line
arrangement's vertices must respect the lines; H. K. Ruud shows that the
answer is no.

Diamond theory.
Steven Cullinane studies the symmetries of the shapes formed by
splitting each square of a grid into dark and light triangles.

Dictionary of Combinatorics,
Joe Fields, U. Illinois at Chicago.

Dilation-free planar graphs.
How can you arrange n points so that the set of all lines between them
forms a planar graph with no extra vertices?





Disjoint
triangles.  Any 3n points in the plane can be partitioned into n
disjoint triangles.  A. Bogomolny gives a simple proof and discusses
some generalizations.

Distinct point set with the same distance multiset.
From K. S. Brown's Math Pages.

eight-point arrangement in which each perpendicular bisector passes
through two other points.

a blind man with a rope could map out a forest.

A
Geometrical Picturebook of finite and combinatorial geometries,
B. Polster, to be published by Springer.

Grid subgraphs.
Jan Kristian Haugland looks for sets of lattice points that induce
graphs with high degree but no short cycles.

Holyhedra.
Jade Vinson solves a question of John Conway on the existence of
finite polyhedra all of whose faces have holes in them
(the Menger sponge provides
an infinite example).

How many intersection points
can you form from an n-line arrangement?
Equivalently, how many opposite pairs of faces can an n-zone
zonohedron have?
It must be a number between n-1 and n(n-1)/2,
but not all of those values are possible.

How many
points can one find in three-dimensional space so that all triangles
are equilateral or isosceles?
One eight-point solution is formed by placing three points
on the axis of a regular pentagon.
This problem seems related to the fact that
any planar point set forms O(n7/3)
isosceles triangles; in three dimensions, Theta(n3) are possible
(by generalizing the pentagon solution above).  From Stan Wagon's
PotW archive.

HypArr,
software for modeling and visualizing convex polyhedra and plane
arrangements,
now seems to be incorporated as a module in a larger
Matlab library for multi-parametric analysis.

Infinite
families of simplicial arrangements.



Integer distances.
Robert Israel gives a nice proof (originally due to Erdös) of the
fact that,
in any non-colinear planar point set in which all distances
are integers, there are only finitely many points.
Infinite sets of points with rational distances are known,
from which arbitrarily large finite sets of points with integer
distances can be constructed; however it is open whether there are even
seven points at integer distances in general position
(no three in a line and no four on a circle).

Interconnection Trees.  Java minimum spanning tree implementation, Joe Ganley, Virginia.

Intersecting cube diagonals.
Mark McConnell asks for a proof that, if a convex polyhedron
combinatorially equivalent to a cube has three of the four
body diagonals meeting at a point, then the fourth one meets
there as well.  There is apparently some connection to toric varieties.

K12
on G6.  Carlo Séquin investigates how to draw a 12-vertex
complete graph as symmetrically as possible on a six-handle surface
(the minimum genus surface on which it can be drawn without crossings).

Kneser-Poulsen Conjecture.
Bezdek and Connelly solve an old problem about pushing disks together.

that can be formed by connecting vertices by non-crossing equal-length
line segments.

Apparently
it is known to be between 220 and 224 inclusive.

Minimize
the slopes. How few different slopes can be formed by the lines
connecting 881 points?
From Stan Wagon's
PotW archive.

Models of Small Geometries.
Burkard Polster draws diagrams of combinatorial configurations such as the
Fano plane and Desargues' theorem (shown below) in an attempt to capture the
mathematical beauty of these geometries.



Monge's
theorem and Desargues' theorem, identified.
Thomas Banchoff relates these two results,
on colinearity of intersections of external tangents to disjoint circles,
and of intersections of sides of perspective triangles, respectively.
He also describes generalizations to higher dimensional spheres.

Odd squared distances.  Warren Smith considers point sets
for which the square of each interpoint distance is an odd integer.
Clearly one can always do this with an appropriately scaled regular simplex;
Warren shows that one can squeeze just one more point in,
iff the dimension is 2 (mod 4).
Moshe Rosenfeld has published a related paper in Geombinatorics
(vol. 5, 1996, pp. 156-159).

simple polygons having all six points as vertices?

Projective
Duality.  This Java applet by F. Henle of Dartmouth demonstrates
three different incidence-preserving translations from points to lines
and vice versa in the projective plane.

Proofs of Euler's Formula.
V-E+F=2, where V, E, and F are respectively the numbers of
vertices, edges, and faces of a convex polyhedron.

A quasi-polynomial bound for the diameter of graphs of polyhedra,
G. Kalai and D. Kleitman, Bull. AMS 26 (1992).  A famous open conjecture in polyhedral
combinatorics (with applications to e.g. the simplex method in linear
programming) states that any two vertices of an n-face polytope are
linked by a chain of O(n) edges.  This paper gives the weaker bound
O(nlog d).

Random spherical arc crossings.
Bill Taylor and Tal Kubo prove that if one takes two random geodesics
on the sphere, the probability that they cross is 1/8.
This seems closely related a famous problem on the probability
of choosing a convex quadrilateral from a planar distribution.
The minimum (over all possible distributions) of this probability
also turns out to solve a seemingly unrelated combinatorial
geometry problem, on the minimum
number of crossings possible in a drawing of the complete graph with
straight-line edges:
see also "The
rectilinear crossing number of a complete graph
and Sylvester's four point problem of geometric probability",
E. Scheinerman and H. Wilf, Amer. Math. Monthly 101 (1994) 939-943,
rectilinear
crossing constant, S. Finch, MathSoft, and
Calluna's pit,
Douglas Reay.

Rigid
regular r-gons.
Erich Friedman asks how many unit-length bars are needed in a
bar-and-joint linkage network to make a unit regular polygon rigid.
What if the polygon can have non-unit-length edges?



Rolling
polyhedra.  Dave Boll investigates Hamiltonian paths on (duals of)
regular polyhedra.

The rotating caliper graph.
A thrackle used in "Average Case Analysis of Dynamic Geometric Optimization"
for maintaining the width and diameter of a point set.

The
Schläfli Double Six.
A lovely photo-essay of models of this configuration,
in which twelve lines each meet five of thirty points.
Unfortunately only the first page seems to be archived...
(This site also referred to
related configurations involving 27 lines meeting either 45 or
135 points, but didn't describe any mathematical details.
For further descriptions of all of these, see Hilbert and
Cohn-Vossen's "Geometry and the Imagination".)

Self-dual
maps, Don McConnell.

Sets of points with many halving lines.
Coordinates for arrangements of 14, 16, and 18 points for which
many of the lines determined by two points split the remaining points
exactly in half.  From my 1992
tech. report.

Simple
polygonizations. Erik Demaine explores the question of how many
different non-crossing traveling salesman tours an n-point set can have.

Simplex/hyperplane intersection.
Doug Zare nicely summarizes the shapes that can arise on intersecting
a simplex with a hyperplane: if there are p points on the hyperplane,
m on one side, and n on the other side, the shape is
(a projective transformation of)
a p-iterated cone over the product of m-1 and n-1 dimensional simplices.

Six-regular toroid.
Mike Paterson asks whether it is possible to make a torus-shaped polyhedron
in which exactly six equilateral triangles meet at each vertex.

Skewered lines.
Jim Buddenhagen notes that four lines in general position in R3
have exactly two lines crossing them all, and asks how this generalizes
to higher dimensions.

Solution
to problem 10769.  Apparently problems of coloring the points of a
sphere so that orthogonal points have different colors (or so that each
set of coordinate basis vectors has multiple colors) has some relevance
to quantum mechanics; see also papers
quant-ph/9905080 and
quant-ph/9911040
(on coloring just the rational points on a sphere), as well as this
four-dimensional construction
of an odd number of basis sets in which each vector appears an even
number of times, showing that one can't color the points on a
four-sphere so that each basis set has exactly one black point.

Solving
the Petersen Graph Zome Challenge.
David MacMahon discovers that there is no way to make a
non-self-intersecting peterson graph with Zome tool.
Includes VRML illustrations.

Sylvester's theorem.
This states that any finite non-colinear point set has
a line containing only two points (equivalently, every zonohedron has a
quadrilateral face).  Michael Larsen, Tim Chow, and Noam
Elkies discuss two proofs and a complex-number generalization.
(They omit the very simple generalization from Euler's
formula: every convex polyhedron has a face of degree at most five.)

The Szilassi Polyhedron.
This polyhedral torus, discovered by
L.
Szilassi, has seven hexagonal faces, all adjacent to each other.
It has an axis of 180-degree symmetry; three pairs of faces are congruent
leaving one unpaired hexagon that is itself symmetric.
Tom
Ace has more images as well as a downloadable unfolded pattern
for making your own copy.
See also Dave Rusin's page on
polyhedral
tori with few vertices and
Ivars'
Peterson's MathTrek article.

Tangencies.
Animated compass and straightedge constructions of
various patterns of tangent circles.


Thrackles
are graphs embedded as a set of curves in the plane that cross each
other exactly once; Conway has conjectured that an n-vertex
thrackle has at most n edges.
Stephan Wehner describes what is known about thrackles.

Triangles and squares.
Slides from a talk I gave relating a simple 2d puzzle, Escher's drawings
of 3d polyhedra, and the combinatorics of 4d polytopes, via angles in
hyperbolic space.  Warning: very large file (~8Mb).
For more technical details see
my
paper with Kuperberg and Ziegler.



Triangulation numbers.  These classify the geometric structure of
viruses.  Many viruses are shaped as simplicial polyhedra consisting of 12
symmetrically placed degree five vertices and more degree six vertices;
the number represents the distance between degree five vertices.

27 lines on the Clebsch cubic, Matthias Weber.

Two-distance sets.
Timothy Murphy and others discuss how many points one can have
in an n-dimensional set, so that there are only two distinct
interpoint distances.  The correct answer turns out to
be n2/2 + O(n).
This
talk abstract by Petr Lisonek (and paper in JCTA 77 (1997) 318-338)

Lesson Plans and Teaching Materials

I've heard parents complain "my daughter makes collages from magazine
clippings in her high school geometry class instead of learning real
math".  Some of the lesson plans listed here are like that,
but are perhaps appropriate as auxiliary material.  The better plans
here teach some real mathematics as the students perform their projects.
I haven't made much attempt to go through the rest of the junkyard
to find appropriate teaching resources that aren't already arranged into
lesson plans; you'd be better off doing it yourself.

Pentagonal Geometry and the Golden Ratio

This page includes geometric problems defined on regular pentagons,
involving pentagonal angles,
or based on the golden ratio (the ratio of diagonal to
side length in a regular pentagon).

A
Brunnian link. Cutting any one of five links allows the remaining
four to be disconnected from each other, so this is in some sense a
generalization of the Borromean rings. However since each pair of links
crosses four times, it can't be drawn with circles.

One can then place horocycles centered on the ideal triangle's vertices
and tangent to each side of the inner equilateral triangle.

##------------------TEXT------------------------##
Tiling

One way to define a tiling is a partition of an infinite space (usually
Euclidean) into pieces having a finite number of distinct shapes.
Tilings can be divided into two types,
periodic and aperiodic, depending on whether they have any
translational symmetries.
If these symmetries exist, they form a lattice.
However there has
been much recent research and excitement on aperiodic tilings
(which lack such symmetries) and their possible realization
in certain crystal structures.  Tilings also have connections
to much of pure mathematics including operator K-theory, dynamical
systems, and non-commutative geometry.

Higher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form

necessarily find
the vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according

Knot Theory

There is of course an enormous body of work on knot invariants,
the 3-manifold topology of knot complements,
connections between knot theory and statistical mechanics, etc.
I am instead interested here primarily in geometric questions
arising from knot embeddings.

Atlas of oriented knots and links, Corinne Cerf extends previous lists of all small knots and links,
to allow each component of the link to be marked by an orientation.

Borromean rings don't exist.
Geoff Mess relates a proof that
the Borromean ring configuration
(in which three loops are tangled together but no pair is linked)
can not be formed out of circles.
Dan Asimov discusses some related higher dimensional questions.
Matthew
Cook conjectures the converse.


Are
Borromean links so rare?
S. Javan relates the history of the links and describes
various generalizations with more than three rings.
For more history and symbolism of the Borromean rings,
see Peter Cromwell's
web site.

A
Brunnian link. Cutting any one of five links allows the remaining
four to be disconnected from each other, so this is in some sense a
generalization of the Borromean rings. However since each pair of links
crosses four times, it can't be drawn with circles.

Colinear points on knots.
Greg Kuperberg
shows that a non-trivial knot or link in R3
necessarily has four colinear points.

Crocheted Seifert surfaces by Matthew Wright. George Hart, Make Magazine.

Curvature of knots.
Steve Fenner proves

Open Problems

Antipodes.
Jim Propp asks whether the two farthest apart points,
as measured by surface distance, on a symmetric convex body
must be opposite each other on the body.
Apparently this is open even for rectangular boxes.

Bounded degree triangulation.
Pankaj Agarwal and Sandeep Sen ask for triangulations of convex polytopes
in which the vertex or edge degree is bounded by a constant or polylog.

Centers of maximum matchings.
Andy Fingerhut asks, given a maximum (not minimum) matching of six
points in the Euclidean plane, whether there is a center point
close to all matched edges (within distance a constant times the length
of the edge).  If so, it could be extended to more points via Helly's theorem.
Apparently this is related to communication network design.
I include a response I sent with a proof (of a constant worse than the
one he wanted, but generalizing as well to bipartite matching).

The chromatic number of the plane.
Gordon Royle and Ilan Vardi summarize what's known about
the famous open problem of how many colors are needed to color
the plane so that no two points at a unit distance apart get the same color.
See also
another article from Dave Rusin's known math pages.



Covering points by rectangles.
Stan Shebs discusses the problem of finding a minimum number of
copies of a given rectangle that will cover all points in some set,
and mentions an application to a computer strategy game.
This is NP-hard, but I don't know how easy it is to approximate;
most related work I know of is on optimizing the rectangle size for a cover
by a fixed number of rectangles.

Cube triangulation.
Can one divide a cube into congruent and disjoint tetrahedra?
And without the congruence assumption,
how many higher dimensional simplices are needed to triangulate a hypercube?
For more on this last problem, see
Triangulating
an n-dimensional cube, S. Finch, MathSoft,
and

immersion into R4 is apparently open.

mathematical constants.

Integer distances.
Robert Israel gives a nice proof (originally due to Erdös) of the
fact that,
in any non-colinear planar point set in which all distances
are integers, there are only finitely many points.
Infinite sets of points with rational distances are known,
from which arbitrarily large finite sets of points with integer
distances can be constructed; however it is open whether there are even
seven points at integer distances in general position
(no three in a line and no four on a circle).

Mirrored room illumination.
A summary by Christine Piatko of the old open problem of, given
a polygon in which all sides are perfect mirrors, and a point source
of light, whether the entire polygon will be lit up.
The answer is no if smooth curves are allowed.
See also Eric Weisstein's page on the
Illumination
Problem.

Open problems:
Demaine - Mitchell -
O'Rourke open problems project
From Jeff Erickson, Duke U.
From Jorge Urrutia, U. Ottawa.

From the 2nd MSI Worksh. on Computational Geometry.
From
SCG '98.

Primes
of a 14-omino.  Michael Reid shows that a 3x6 rectangle with a 2x2
bite removed can tile a (much larger) rectangle.
It is open whether it can do this using an odd number of copies.

Prince
Rupert's tetrahedra? One tetrahedron can be entirely contained in
another, and yet have a larger sum of edge lengths. But how much larger?
From Stan Wagon's
PotW archive.

Pushing
disks together. If unit disks move so their pairwise distances all
decrease, does the area of their union also decrease?

A quasi-polynomial bound for the diameter of graphs of polyhedra,
G. Kalai and D. Kleitman, Bull. AMS 26 (1992).  A famous open conjecture in polyhedral
combinatorics (with applications to e.g. the simplex method in linear
programming) states that any two vertices of an n-face polytope are
linked by a chain of O(n) edges.  This paper gives the weaker bound
O(nlog d).

Rational triangles.
This well known problem asks whether there exists a triangle with
the side lengths, medians, altitudes, and area all rational numbers.
Randall Rathbun provides some "near misses" -- triangles in which
most but not all of these quantities are irrational.
See also Dan Asimov's question in geometry.puzzles
about integer right-angled tetrahedra.

Squares on a Jordan curve.
Various people discuss the open problem of whether any Jordan curve
in the plane contains four points forming the vertices of a square,
and the related but not open problem of how to place
a square table level on a hilltop.
This is also in the
geometry.puzzles archive.

Sums of square roots.  A major bottleneck
in proving NP-completeness for geometric problems is a mismatch between
the real-number and Turing machine models of computation: one is good
for geometric algorithms but bad for reductions, and the other vice
versa.  Specifically, it is not known on Turing machines how to quickly
compare a sum of distances (square roots of integers) with an integer or
other similar sums, so even (decision versions of) easy problems such as
the minimum spanning tree are not known to be in NP.  
Joe O'Rourke
discusses an approach to this problem based on bounding the smallest
difference between two such sums, so that one could know how precise an
approximation to compute.

Tiling problems.
Collected at a problem session at Smith College, 1993, by
Marjorie Senechal.


Tiling the unit square with rectangles.
Erich Friedman
shows that the 5/6 by 5/6 square can always be tiled with 1/(k+1) by
1/(k+1) squares.
Will all the 1/k by 1/(k+1) rectangles, for k>0,
fit together in a unit square?
Note that the sum of the rectangle areas is 1. 
Marc Paulhus can fit them into
a square of side 1.000000001: "An algorithm for packing squares",
J. Comb. Th. A 82 (1998) 147-157,
MR1620857.

Triangulations with many different areas.
Eddie Grove asks for a function t(n) such that any n-vertex convex polygon
has a triangulation with at least t(n) distinct triangle areas,
and also discusses a special case in which the vertices are points in a
lattice.

Unfolding convex polyhedra.
Catherine Schevon discusses whether it is always possible
to cut a convex polyhedron's edges so its boundary unfolds into a simple
planar polygon.
Dave Rusin's known math pages include
another article by J. O'Rourke on the same problem.

Unsolved

geometry and number theory.

Width, Diameter, and Geometric Inequalities

Antipodes.
Jim Propp asks whether the two farthest apart points,
as measured by surface distance, on a symmetric convex body
must be opposite each other on the body.
Apparently this is open even for rectangular boxes.

Centers of maximum matchings.
Andy Fingerhut asks, given a maximum (not minimum) matching of six
points in the Euclidean plane, whether there is a center point
close to all matched edges (within distance a constant times the length
of the edge).  If so, it could be extended to more points via Helly's theorem.
Apparently this is related to communication network design.
I include a response I sent with a proof (of a constant worse than the
one he wanted, but generalizing as well to bipartite matching).

A Counterexample to Borsuk's Conjecture, J. Kahn and G. Kalai,
Bull. AMS 29 (1993).  Partitioning certain high-dimensional polytopes
into pieces with smaller diameter requires a number of pieces
exponential in the dimension.

A fractal beta-skeleton with high dilation.
Beta-skeletons are graphs used, among other applications, in predicting
which pairs of cities should be connected by roads in a road network.
But if you build your road network this way, it may take you a long time
to get from point a to point b.



Graham's hexagon, maximizing the ratio of area to diameter.
You'd expect it to be a regular hexagon, right?  Wrong.
From MathSoft's favorite constants pages.
See also
Wolfgang
Schildbach's java animation of this hexagon and similar n-gons for larger values of n.

The isoperimetric problem for pinwheel tilings.
In these aperiodic tilings (generated by a substitution system involving
similar triangles) vertices are connected by paths almost as good
as the Euclidean straight-line distance.

The
Kakeya-Besicovitch problem.
Paul Wellin describes this famous
problem of rotating a needle in a planar set of minimal area. As it
turns out the area can be made arbitrarily close to zero. See also 
Steven Finch's
page on Kakeya-Besicovitch constants, and
Eric
Weisstein's page on the Kakeya Needle Problem.

Kelvin conjecture counterexample.
Evelyn Sander forwards news about the discovery by Phelan and Weaire
of a better way to partition space
into equal-volume low-surface-area cells.
Kelvin had conjectured that the truncated octahedron provided the optimal
solution, but this turned out not to be true.
See also Ruggero Gabbrielli's comparison of equal-volume partitions and
JavaView
foam models.



The Margulis Napkin Problem.
Jim Propp asked for a proof that the perimeter of a flat origami
figure must be at most that of the original starting square.
Gregory Sorkin provides a simple example showing that on the contrary,
the perimeter can be arbitrarily large.

Minimax elastic bending energy of sphere eversions.
Rob Kusner, U. Mass. Amherst. 

Minimizing
surface area to volume ratio in a cube.

What is the smallest area shape (in a given class of shapes) that
can cover any unit-length path?
Part of Mathsoft's
collection of
mathematical constants.

Not. AMS
Cover, Apr. 1995. This illustration for an article on geometric
tomography depicts objects (a cuboctahedron and warped rhombic
dodecahedron) that disguise themselves as regular tetrahedra
by having the same width function or x-ray image.

A quasi-polynomial bound for the diameter of graphs of polyhedra,
G. Kalai and D. Kleitman, Bull. AMS 26 (1992).  A famous open conjecture in polyhedral
combinatorics (with applications to e.g. the simplex method in linear
programming) states that any two vertices of an n-face polytope are
linked by a chain of O(n) edges.  This paper gives the weaker bound
O(nlog d).

Reuleaux triangles. These curves of
constant width, formed by combining three circular arcs into an
equilateral triangle, can drill out (most of) a square hole.





Sofa
movers' problem.
This well-known problem asks for the largest area of a two-dimensional
region that can be moved through a hallway with a right-angled bend.
Part of Mathsoft's
collection of
mathematical constants.

The tea bag problem.
How big a volume can you enclose by two square sheets of paper
joined at the edges?
See also
the cubical teabag
problem.

Uniqueness of focal points.
A focal point (aka equichord) in a star-shaped curve is a point such that
all chords through the point have the same length.
Noam Elkies asks whether it is possible to have more than one focal point,
and Curtis McMullen discusses a generalization to non-star-shaped curves.
This problem has recently been put to rest by Marek Rychlik.

Universal
coverage constants.
What is the minimum area figure of a given type that covers all
unit-diameter sets?
Part of Mathsoft's
collection of
mathematical constants.

Volume of a torus.
Paul Kunkel describes a simple and intuitive way of finding the formula for a
torus's volume by relating it to a cylinder.

contained in a unit area rectangle.

copies of a given rectangle that will cover all points in some set,
and mentions an application to a computer strategy game.
This is NP-hard, but I don't know how easy it is to approximate;

Curvature of crossing convex curves.

Equilateral
triangles.  Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a
square torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles
in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; my answer
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, shown below.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see Fáry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.

and the related but not open problem of how to place
a square table level on a hilltop.

This states that any finite non-colinear point set has
a line containing only two points (equivalently, every zonohedron has a
quadrilateral face).  Michael Larsen, Tim Chow, and Noam
Elkies discuss two proofs and a complex-number generalization.
(They omit the very simple generalization from Euler's
formula: every convex polyhedron has a face of degree at most five.)

discusses an algorithm for constructing the Voronoi cells in a planar

number theory: Euclid's algorithm for integer GCD's, continued
fractions, and good approximations of real numbers by rationals.
Higher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form
zonotopes) are much harder -- one can find a basis of
short vectors using the well-known LLL algorithm, but this doesn't
necessarily find
the vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according
to Senechal's Quasicrystals and Geometry, although the set
of Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not
known whether this set always contains a basis.)

the geometry and false at some other point.

Lattice Theory and Geometry of Numbers

Informally, a lattice is an infinite arrangement of points
spaced with sufficient regularity that one can shift any point
onto any other point by some symmetry of the
arrangement.  More formally, a lattice can be defined as a discrete
subgroup of a finite-dimensional vector space (the subgroup is
often required not to lie within any subspace of the vector space, which can
be expressed formally by saying that the quotient of the space by the
lattice is compact).

The simplest and most
commonly-studied example of
a lattice (the "integer grid") is formed by the points all Cartesian
coordinates of which are integers.
Other types of lattices arise in crystallography and in
sphere packing, where they are
used to describe the locations of atoms or spheres.
Lattices are also particularly important in the theory of periodic tilings, since they describe the set of
translational symmetries of a tiling.

See also Sloane's sphere-packing and lattice theory publications.

Connect the dots.
Ed Pegg asks how many sides are needed in a (self-crossing) polygon,
that passes through every point of an n*n grid.
I added a similar puzzle with circular arcs.


Crystallographic
topology.  C. Johnson and M. Burnett of Oak Ridge National Lab use
topological methods to understand and classify the symmetries of the
lattice structures formed by crystals.  (Somewhat technical.)

Equilateral
triangles.  Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a
square torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles
in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; my answer
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, shown below.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see Fáry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.



Grid subgraphs.
Jan Kristian Haugland looks for sets of lattice points that induce
graphs with high degree but no short cycles.

Mike Kolountzakis' publications include several recent papers on lattice tiling.

Lattice pentagons.
The vertices of a regular pentagon are not the subset of any lattice.

The
no-three-in-line problem.
How many points can be placed in an n*n grid with no three
on a common line?  The solution is known to be between 1.5n and
2n.  Achim Flammenkamp discusses some new computational results
including bounds on the number of symmetric solutions.

Polyominoes, figures formed from subsets
of the square lattice tiling of the plane.  Interesting problems
associated with these shapes include finding all of them, determining
which ones tile the plane, and dissecting rectangles or other shapes
into sets of them.  Also includes related
material on polyiamonds, polyhexes, and animals.

Russian math olympiad problem on lattice
points.
Proof that, for any five lattice points in convex position,
another lattice point is on or inside
the inner pentagon of the five-point star they form.

Spiral tilings.
These similarity tilings are formed by applying the exponential function
to a lattice in the complex number plane.



Triangulations with many different areas.
Eddie Grove asks for a function t(n) such that any n-vertex convex polygon
has a triangulation with at least t(n) distinct triangle areas,
and also discusses a special case in which the vertices are points in a
lattice.

Untitled,
Forbes Gallery, 1987, Ken Goldberg.

Voronoi diagrams of lattices.
Greg Kuperberg
discusses an algorithm for constructing the Voronoi cells in a planar
lattice of points.  This problem is closely related to some important
number theory: Euclid's algorithm for integer GCD's, continued
fractions, and good approximations of real numbers by rationals.
Higher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form
zonotopes) are much harder -- one can find a basis of
short vectors using the well-known LLL algorithm, but this doesn't
necessarily find
the vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according
to Senechal's Quasicrystals and Geometry, although the set
of Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not
known whether this set always contains a basis.)

Triangles and Simplices

These pointers discuss triangles and their higher-dimensional generalizations
(simplices).
I am particularly interested in triangulation
by which I mean partitioning regions into triangles,
tetrahedra, or higher dimensional simplices, for various applications
including finite element mesh generation and surface interpolation.
(The other meaning of triangulation involves
determining locations and distances from certain measurements.)
For more material on the first type of triangulation,
see the mesh generation section
of Geometry in Action
or the list of my own
triangulation papers.
For other kinds of partitions, see the page on
dissection.

question was to carve three columns out of a prism-shaped block of
marble with as little wasted stone as possible, but it wasn't until 1967
that it was shown that these three mutually tangent circles are never
the right answer.

Geometric Topology

This area of mathematics is about the assignment of geometric structures
to topological spaces, so that they "look like"
geometric spaces.  For instance, compact two dimensional surfaces
can have a local geometry based on the sphere
(the sphere itself, and the projective plane), based
on the Euclidean plane (the torus and the Klein bottle), or based
on the hyperbolic plane (all other surfaces).
Similar questions in three dimensions have more complicated answers;
Thurston showed that there are eight possible geometries,
and conjectured that all 3-manifolds can be split into pieces having
these geometries.
Computer solution of these questions by programs like SnapPea
has proved very useful in the study of knot theory
and other topological problems.

Circle fractal

One could also get something like this by inversion, starting with three

Filling space with unit circles.  Daniel
Asimov asks what fraction of 3-dimensional space can be filled by a
collection of disjoint unit circles.  (It may not be obvious that this
fraction is nonzero, but a standard construction allows one to construct
a solid torus out of circles, and one can then pack tori to fill space,
leaving some uncovered gaps between the tori.)  The geometry center has
information in several places on this problem, the best being an
article
describing a way of filling space by unit circles (discontinuously).

Five circle theorem.
Karl Rubin and Noam Elkies asked for a proof that a certain construction
leads to five cocircular points.  This result was subsequently discovered

Rectilinear Geometry

This includes geometric problems defined on squares and rectangles,
higher dimensional boxes, cubes, and hypercubes,
right triangles and other right-angled figures,
and "taxicab geometry" in which distances are measured
in terms of axis-parallel paths.

Acute square triangulation.
Can one partition the square into triangles with all angles acute?
How many triangles are needed, and what is the best angle bound possible?




Animated proof
of the Pythagorean theorem, M. D. Meyerson, US Naval Academy.

Antipodes.
Jim Propp asks whether the two farthest apart points,
as measured by surface distance, on a symmetric convex body
must be opposite each other on the body.
Apparently this is open even for rectangular boxes.

An aperiodic set of Wang cubes, J. UCS 1:10 (1995).
Culik and Kari describe how to increase the dimension of sets of
aperiodic tilings, turning a 13-square set of tiles into a 21-cube set.

Box in a box.
What is the smallest cube that can be put inside another cube
touching all its faces?
There is a simple solution, but it seems difficult to prove its correctness.
The solution and proof are even prettier in four dimensions.



Calabi's triangle constant, defining the unique non-equilateral triangle
with three equally large inscribed squares.
Is there a three-dimensional analogue?
From MathSoft's favorite constants pages.

Circular quadrilaterals.
Bill Taylor notes that if one connects the opposite midpoints
of a partition of the circle into four chords, the two line segments
you get are at right angles.  Geoff Bailey supplies an elegant proof.

Covering points by rectangles.
Stan Shebs discusses the problem of finding a minimum number of
copies of a given rectangle that will cover all points in some set,
and mentions an application to a computer strategy game.
This is NP-hard, but I don't know how easy it is to approximate;
most related work I know of is on optimizing the rectangle size for a cover
by a fixed number of rectangles.

Hew Wolff asks questions about the minimum total length, or the minimum volume of a rectangular box, needed to form different knots as three-dimensional polygons using only integer-length axis-parallel edges.

Packing rectangles into similar rectangles.
A problem of the month from Erich Friedman's Math Magic site:
how small an aspect-ratio-r rectangle can contain n unit-area
aspect-ratio-r rectangles?
As you might hope for in a problem dealing with aspect ratios
of rectangles, the golden rectangle does show up, as one of the
breakpoints in the size function for packing five smaller rectangles.

Solution
to problem 10769.  Apparently problems of coloring the points of a
sphere so that orthogonal points have different colors (or so that each
set of coordinate basis vectors has multiple colors) has some relevance
to quantum mechanics; see also papers

quant-ph/9911040
(on coloring just the rational points on a sphere), as well as this

of an odd number of basis sets in which each vector appears an even
number of times, showing that one can't color the points on a
four-sphere so that each basis set has exactly one black point.

leaving some uncovered gaps between the tori.)  The geometry center has

touching hypercubes.  Erich Friedman asks how to partition the unit cubes

I've seen the same question asked for d-dimensional hypercubes
formed out of 2^d unit hypercubes; there is a lower bound of roughly
2d/2 (from embedding a 2*2d/2*2d/2 box
into the hypercube)
and an upper bound of O(2d/2 sqrt d)
(from computing how many cubes must be in a polycube
to give it enough faces to touch all the others).

Solution
of Conway-Radin-Sadun problem.
Dissections of combinations of regular dodecahedra, regular icosahedra,

Solution
to problem 10769.  Apparently problems of coloring the points of a
sphere so that orthogonal points have different colors (or so that each
set of coordinate basis vectors has multiple colors) has some relevance
to quantum mechanics; see also papers

	VORONOI METHODS IN GEOMATICS

DATE:	Thursday, February 8, 1996

TIME:	1:30 p.m.

PLACE:	Room 5115, Herzberg Building
	Carleton University

ABSTRACT

Occasionally, a new technique appears that has the potential to
significantly modify a discipline. At present it appears that recent
developments in Voronoi diagram methods in Computational Geometry have the
potential to change many of the ways we look at spatial problems in the
discipline of Geomatics, or Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

In an attempt to escape from some of the limitations of traditional GIS
data structures, the Voronoi diagram is an attractive alternative - it is
a space-filling structure, eliminating many problems of the
line-intersection spatial model. It has various forms in various
dimensions, and by making it fully dynamic the traditional GIS operations
may be extended in new directions.

A variety of GIS-type problems will be described, along with possible
solutions. The real challenge for the future is not only to implement more
efficient versions of traditional GIS functions, but to see how the two
disciplines may combine to produce completely new functionality.

Subject:        Re: Database structures for Street Addresses
To:             rpl@netcom.com
Organization:   WinterNet
Date:           Thu, 25 Jan 1996 19:17:07 GMT

Address databases are much more complex than people think, and their end use 
determines much of the needed complexity: address matching, address lookup, 
spatial allocation, spatial analysis, thematic analysis, etc. all have special 
address related characteristics.

Keep in mind the fact that an address is only an identifier for one or more 
entities (land, structures, occupancies, events, etc.) over some range of 
time. The address has to be associated with the thing(s) or events to which it 
applies in an explicit relationship. The name is not the thing it describes, 
just like John Smith could be several people and a good bottle of beer, 10310 
102 Ave. NW, Edmonton, AB. T5J 2X6 could describe many different things 
depending on context.

Regarding the format of address fields: we have: SuiteName orSuiteNumber, 
HouseNumber, HouseNumberSuffix, (StreetName, StreetDirection, StreetType) or 
(StreetNumber, StreetNumberSuffix, StreetType), Quadrant. Beyond this there is 
handling of municipality name, post code(ZIP in the US). Then there are 
NamedLocations which are often used as surrogate addresses.

As is pointed out in the earlier posting, Soundex or some other spelling and 
format standardization is vital when using uncontrolled lists of addresses and 
attempting the match them up or link them to spatial locations.

I would suggest that you look through the proceedings of URISA Conferences, 
where some 30 years of experience in the field are covered. Some authors are: 
P. Eichleberger, W. Hurst, W. Huxhold, and myself (J. Guthrie).

Careful planning can result in flexible and powerful systems, 
oversimplification can result in frustration and disappointment.

Rochester, NY, US has been going between GIS & CADD and vice versa
for a number of years (Arc/Info and Microstation).  We use our street
reconstruction CADD as-builts to up-date GIS curb, sidewalk &
driveway layers.  We have developed digital as-built coordinate and
layer standards to allow easy interchange between CADD and GIS
and have developed an aml to do heads-up on-screen GIS editing.

We use GIS in CADD in many ways, including street reconstruction
project location maps, street curb locations for restriping plans in
milling/resurfacing contracts, location of  buildings in CADD drawings
in order to save instrument survey costs (a 10 to 30% cost savings),
production of strip maps for our handicapped accessibility sidewalk
retro-fit program, ad-hoc analysis of turn radii, say for over-sized truck
routes.  All of the above are done in CADD using GIS layers.  Usually
street design projects require instrument surveys, but we are finding
many, many places where survey accuracy is not required and thus
we can use our 50' scale national map accuracy standard (+- 1.25')
GIS layers of great use in our Engineering Bureau.
Sounds like you are on the right track--you need coordinate and layer
standards to allow easy transfer between the two systems.

There is an interesting "Atlas of Science" project that has been undertaken
by the people that do the Science Citation Index.  As far as I know, only
the map for molecular biology has been published so far.  As I recall,
here is the procedure.  The citations in the literature are analyzed for
a certain period; those items cited most (from before the period) are
singled out as "citation classics".  Then the "distance" between research
papers of the period is determined by the number of citation
classics they cite in common.  They find that research papers tend to
fall into groups of closely related papers, which they call "specialties".
But also they get a distance between specialties.  Then they were able to
arrange the specialties in a plane so that the distances were approximated.
The result is a "Map" of the field of molecular biology.

Here is the bibliographic information:

Computational Geometry Problems in
Integrated Circuit Design and Layout



From an invited talk by V. T. Rajan at the

5th MSI Worksh. on Computational Geometry,
Stony Brook, October 20, 1995.  Notes by D. Eppstein.

Problems

In his invited talk, Rajan discussed several geometric problems in VLSI
layout and analysis:

Polygon simplification.  In the specific version Rajan gave, one is
given a polygonal input P and must output a simpler polygon C which
covers the input, together with (the boundary representation of) the
set-theoretic difference C-P.  C must have axis-parallel sides, although P need
not, and the goal is to choose a C having a given number of edges and
minimizing the area of C-P.  He didn't say what this was used for, but
I've seen similar problems applied to PC board simulation.
He described a greedy heuristic for this problem but
could find no theoretical results.

Design rule verification.  The usual sort of rule one wants to check
is that objects of certain types are separated by certain distances, but
he also talked at some length about rules requiring that e.g. every 100
by 100 micron square region of a chip should be covered by metal at a
density of between 30% and 50% (in order for the fabrication process to
work well).

Calculation of capacitance between pairs of polygons
(either overlapping or adjacent to each other in the layout).

Logic verification.  Interpretation of layout features as components and nets,
and verification that the circuit matches the original logic design.

Process proximity correction.  In the fabrication process, feature shapes will
be affected by the presence or absence of nearby objects, and this needs
to be pre-corrected for in the design.


Assumptions and Requirements

There are several factors relevant here for selection of an algorithm.
The input coordinates come from the design process and are
assumed to be integers.  The integer units do not necessarily
correspond to the feature size, and sometimes one may want to round
the input to a larger grid, but this should be done in a way
that will avoid introducing unnecessary degeneracy.
The results of an algorithm should be exact rather
than approximate; in particular floating point computation is only acceptable
as a way of speeding up exact integer arithmetic, but is not acceptable
if it leads to round-off.  Therefore one can't in native code work with
equations of much higher degree than quadratic.


Robustness is very important - the program must work well even for
degenerate or somewhat malformed input.  The input polygon sides are
likely to be mostly axis-parallel, but some diagonals can occur,
especially at 45 degree angles.  (There appears to be little in the way
of theoretical results on such "almost-orthogonal" inputs.  Automated
layout typically produces axis-parallel layouts but critical regions are
likely to have been hand optimized with sides of other angles.)  Worst
case time complexity is important, but the program should also be
asymptotically good in the average case, since invariably people will
run his codes on much larger inputs than he was anticipating.  It is
also important that the program run well on small inputs, since the
other thing people do with his code is run it on batches of very many
small inputs.


Any algorithms used
must be simple enough that they can implement them quickly, and
so that they can make changes later if necessary.
Object oriented design is important - Rajan has found that
imperative-style pseudo-code is a bad way of communicating with his programmers.


One particular feature of the input is problematic, and not adequately
treated by the theory literature.  The inputs Rajan deals with often come
from hierarchical specifications, in which an object at one level of the
specification may
be repeated several times at a higher level.  One can flatten this
specification out to form the usual sort of polygonal input, but at a
cost of multiplying the size by a large factor, typically from around 5
for random logic to around 50 for memory.  It would be helpful
to develop algorithms that could deal with this sort of hierarchical
representation directly.

Implementation

Initially they were solving the sorts of problems listed above using a
sweep-line technique
that was originally written with the assumption of axis-parallel sides,
and that had been modified to support 45 degree lines as well.
However they were finding it inflexible and insufficiently robust.


Inspired by Sugihara's experiments showing that randomized incremental
Voronoi diagrams could be practical for large inputs,
Rajan then had a programmer working with him write up Mulmuley's randomized
incremental algorithm for constructing trapezoidal decompositions of
line segment arrangements.  Among the advantages of explicitly
constructing a trapezoidal decomposition are that you can re-use it
several times, and that you can choose your favorite order to traverse it.

The choice of a data representation turned
out to be important; Rajan first told the programmer to do anything that
seemed reasonable, but the project bogged down
before he could get it working.  Rajan then tried Guibas and Stolfi's
quad-edge data structure, which worked much better but perhaps involves
more overhead than necessary.  At the time, the extra overhead was unimportant
because this part of the code was still much faster than the other
things being done to the input,
but now those other things have been improved and he's thinking of
trying to speed up the trapezoidal decomposition by using a more
streamlined data structure.


Nowadays, whenever someone comes to Rajan with a geometric problem,
he tries to fit it into his trapezoidal decomposition framework.
For instance one can test for overlapping objects
(or, after blowing up each object by a given amount, test for objects
that are too close to each other) by simply keeping a count for each
cell of the number of objects covering that cell, incrementing or decrementing
the count as one traverses the decomposition.


Rajan also talked at some length about his implementation for
testing density ground rules.  For the example of such a rule described earlier,
he would first reduce the complexity of the problem by
partitioning the input region into 10 by 10 micron squares, and computing
the density within each square.  He then only considers 100 by 100 micron
squares aligned with the 10 by 10 grid.  The density in each large
square can then be found by averaging 100 small square values.
But by using standard running total techniques one can instead use only
O(1) operations per large square.
To find the density in each small square, he overlays the original input
with a grid, using his trapezoidal decomposition
(he cited some GIS-related work here).


A question from the audience asked how he tells, with such large
inputs (as much as 2 gigabytes) whether his algorithms really are
correct.  The answer is of course testing, on smaller examples, and
especially cross-comparison with previous codes for the same problem.
When the two differ, he then has to tediously by hand try to figure out
why.  His co-workers are very conservative about replacing working code,
and even when he finds discrepancies caused by bugs in the old code it
is hard to persuade them that the bugs are a problem - they would
sometimes prefer his new code be consistent with the bugs.  The final
test of correctness is whether the VLSI chip works - if it doesn't,
that's a costly $100,000 mistake.  If it does, no one cares whether the
analysis was perfect.

Computational Results

Rajan showed some tables of numbers showing that the trapezoidal decomposition
(which is robust and works for inputs of all angles) is about ten times slower than
the more specialized plane sweep method.  However it is also about ten times
newer so the comparison is not really fair; also he pointed out that
the factor is constant rather than polynomial.  (He also compared both methods
with another method for one problem that was polynomially worse; as one would expect,
the polynomial won out over the constants quickly.)


Later, we discussed these numbers in a conversation with Ken Clarkson
and Mike Goodrich (but after Rajan had left).  Ken seemed to think that
the factor of ten was pretty typical for plane sweep vs. randomized
incremental techniques.  The main advantage he seems to be gaining from
the randomized incremental technique is that Rajan has already written it
and doesn't need to change it for each new problem he solves.
But we wondered whether it wouldn't make sense to replace his code with
code that constructs the same trapezoidal decomposition using a plane sweep method.
(The difference between this and where he started was that the original
code did not construct a trapezoidalization, instead it apparently required you
to fit whatever else you were doing into the plane sweep.)

Hexahedron here means combinatorially equivalent to a cube.
This can be taken as a question in combinatorial topology,
where the faces can be curvilinear, or one can insist that
the hexahedra really have linear faces.   Let's look at
the topological question first.

One way to view this problem is to dualize, that is, take
the dual subdivision.   The dual of a cell division of the
sphere by quadrilaterals
is characterized by the property that edges meet in 4's.  You
can think of it as a subdivision of the sphere obtained by
drawing some possibly self-intersecting  closed curves that meet
themselves and meet each other transversely.  This is like
a knot or link projection.   

A hexahedral cell division of the ball is dual to a subdivision
obtained by a collection of surfaces inside the ball, intersecting
transverely.  

Each double curve (where a surface intersects itself) has to either
be closed, or meet the boundary in two points.  So a necessary condition
is that there be an even number of quadrilaterals.  (There do exist
convex polyhedra with an odd number of quadrilateral sides, so
this is a nonvacuous condition.)

Given a system of curves that does have an even number of self-intersections,
it is possible to find a surface with transveral self-intersections having
the system of curves as its boundary.  (not necessarily dual to
a hexahedral decomposition yet though, at this point).
First, a simple closed curve bounds a disk.  Second, if there is any
pair of self-intersections connected by an arc on the system of
curves, you can pair them up with a double line of surface, and
reduce the problem to one with two fewer double points.  The only
remaining possibility is that each component of the curve is
a figure eight.  You can connect any two such together.

This gives a way to construct the surface with boundary the given
curves.  It may not be dual to a hexahedral decomposition, because
for instance there may be no interior vertices (corresponding to
hexahedra) at all.   So, add a bunch of spheres with enough intersection
points with the existing surface to make lots of interior vertices.
This turns it into the dual of a hexahedral decomposition.

This answers the topological question.
****
As for the geometric question:  My first guess is it can be done
geometrically if it can be done topologically, but it
looks very tricky.  If you're using curvilinear coordinates, then
it's irrelevant.  Which question are you really trying to answer?

It is known that any
combinatorial subdivision of the sphere into quadrilaterals can
be realized by a convex polyhedron; one strategy would be first
to try to show everything can be gotten into convex form (by constructing
quadrilateral-cross-section tubes), then analyzing further obstructions.

By the way, one easy construction for certain hexahedral decompositions:
a tetrahedron divides into 4 hexahedra, so if you start with something
with triangulated boundary and divide into quadrilateals, you can
always extend it.

Well, actually, there has been some serious work in this area, though the
problem is by no means solved, or, more accurately, there are several claims of
solutions, all different. 

David Kindersley, a noted British stone carver and lettering artist, and Neil
Wiseman, computer scientist at Cambridge University, have collaborated for two
decades on algorithmic methods of letterspacing. Kindersley has written on this
research in a little booklet called *Optical Letterspacing for New Printing
Systems*, which appeared in the 1970's and has, I believe, come out in at least
one later edition. I believe also that he and Wiseman have published accounts
of it elsewhere, as well, but I don't have the references at hand. For a while,
and perhaps still, they were offering to license their algorithms to software
companies, but I do not know if any firms took them up on the deal. Too bad,
because they had some pretty interesting results. Their algorithms have changed
and evolved over the years, but at one time they were based on measuring the
moments of intertia of letters, as though they were cut-out spun about their
vertical axes. 

URW has also done quite a lot of research on this problem, and their "Kernus"
software is the commercial result. I don't know what their latest algorithms
are, but at one time they were based on the model of electrostatic repulsion.

Other algorithms have been linear - equalizing distances between letters, which
doesn't give good results, unless you like the weird look that results, which
some people do, or areal - equalizing areas between letters, which works sort
of mediocrely, if you do some ad hoc fudging, especially in defining the
"meniscus" of internal vs. external space in a letter like 'c', or various
baroque schemes intended to remedy the obvious deficiencies in the linear and
areal approaches. 

I personally am partial toward approaches that analyze letters as spatial
frequencies, for example by low-pass filtering the letters and adjusting
their spacing so as to achieve the cleanest spectrum for the lower frequencies
in the word image, but I don't know of anyone doing that commercially, and
besides, I barely understand what I mean by that myself!

I think you should be aware that the method is patented, by David
Kindersley and Neil Wiseman, the patent was then held by a company
called Cambridge SuperVision, formed by the two plus an investor, who
have since signed over exclusive rights to the patent and associated
methods to us, Harlequin Limited.

We have, available now, a portable software library to perform OCS,
and other spacing processes required my modern typographers.  If you
have a serious interest in this, please do contact Harlequin again
for details.

BTW, yes, it is hard to implement in terms of getting the maths right
every time, and choosing the correct variables to control the
calculations.  Obviously I will say no more.

Wouldn't this result in the same kerning for an E with small filled
triangles as serifs and an E with very long, thin serifs (which would
need about the same kerning as an N).  And wouldn't the difference in
kerning be to big for VA and AV?  I spent some time thinking about
automatic kerning, as I thought it might be a good subject for my
thesis (computer science), but doesn't seem to be so appropriate.  Too
bad.

Well, I know what it means, and I had an Aha! reaction to the idea.
There is a Scientific American article in about 1965 on recognition
of faces that, if I trust 20 year old memories (1), shows the 
results of several digitized portraits of Washington and other well 
known images that have been bandpassed at various frequencies.

They discuss a "critical bandpass region" where interference is 
high,  and show that there can be large noise outside this region 
that does not interfere very much with recognition.

Gosh, I can see myself spending *all* my hobby time budget adjusting 
various metafont files to make the letters have similar frequency 
signatures, including certain harmonics, and adjusting the kerning 
so that the phase matching is good.

I can see the adjustment of stems and serifs to various spatial
frequency harmonics as a second topic, just in cast not enough
time is spent in the first study.

1) 1994-1965 = 29.  I read it more recently.

I'm afraid I can't help you with the patent numbers, but my
understanding of the centre spacing points are as follows. Note that
Logos depends to a great degree on the letters themselves being
'correctly formed' -- ie. Kindersley's notion of correct spacing is
inextricably linked to this ideas of correct letterforms. It is a
system based on visual balance, which means that all the letters must
carefully balanced with each other. You mention the problems of
correctly spacing the Bembo uppercase R; Kindersley may well  have
simply rejected the form.

For the spacing of uppercase letters under Logos, R is actually the
key letter. According to Kindersley (quoted in Rosemary Sassoon's
excellent 'The Practical Guide to Lettering and Applied Calligraphy'),
'The relation of space to letter should remain constant, in such a way
that the optical vertical centre of any letter is also the
mathematical vertical centre of the space which with letter occupies.
Thus the R, which in most alphabets is the most off-centre
mathematically, becomes the key to the spacing throughout the
alphabet.'

I can upload a diagram, if people would find it useful, but the
treatment of the R is basically as follows. The optical vertical
centre of the R must be determined by eye. (Kindersley did a great
deal of work in optics, to devise an electronic equivalent for this,
but never seems to have matched his own ability to see the centre.)
Once the optical vertical centre of the letter has been identified, a
line, A, is drawn through it. A horizontal measurement is taken from
the base of line A to the base of line B, which is drawn vertically at
the tip of the R's leg. This distance, A-B, is then measured to the
left, from A, to produce A-C, where C is becomes the left sidebearing
of the character. From this, the sidebearings of all verticals can be
determined.

This is the basis of Logos, and from it one can deduce both the
strengths and the weaknesses of the system. The system does not, for
example, take into account the optical effect of the thin vertical
stems found in most uppercase Ns, which require narrower spacing than
the thicker stems of most other letters. On the positive side, the
system guarantees certain typographical niceties, such as optically
justified margins.

As Kindersley admitted, concluding his anaylsis of the uppercase R,
'This is the underlying principle of mys standard spacing, but there
are many modifications that have to be made in order to produce a
really even fit.'

The only way I know of to do this is with sectored kerning, e.g. as used
by the Compugraphic MCS series typesetters years ago...
The idea of sectored kerning is that you have a low resolution surrogate.
For example, with 4 sectors, you might represent boy as

    #
    ### ### ###
    ### ###  ##
	     ##

Now, you can fit Toy like this:

    #####
      #  
      # ### ###
      # ###  ##
	     ##

This usually needs to be augmented by kern pairs for the exceptions, and
it turns out to be tricky to define the sector heights, and also to
determine the values, since changing a single value -- e.g. the width
of the top of `T' -- affects every letter combination next to a T.

In practice, systems using this normally used four vertical sectors, and
allowed widths from 0 to 256 both on each side of the character, measured
outwards.

I'm not aware of any modern systems working this way.

In principle, you could kern across fonts as long as the x-height,
descender-height and cap-height were the same, and get plausible, if not
always excellent, results.   In practice, I don't recall any systems that
did this, except possibly the Compugraphic MCS series (I've forgotten).

I imagined the kern-glyphs being less blocky, using curves more closely
related to the image-glyph than your kern-bands. Perhaps, like the extent
of a "field" created by the "mass" of the black of the letter, heavy parts
of the letter would be relatively far from the kern-edge, while the
kern-edge would come very close to thin parts. This would be achievable
algorithmically, with maybe only a little fine-tuning needed.

I think this probably isn't ideal. What about characters that bulge in the
middle? White space should not be treated as if it were a glyph - which it
is only in a narrow, technical, font-format sense. Rather, a system should
ensure that the horizontal minimum distance (HMD) between two kern-glyphs
either side of a space is "space-width", rather than zero (the system's
HMD value for unspaced kern-glyphs).

From your picture, it's not clear how the system would determine the
"optically justifying margins" (no character has a "standard" advance
width any more). A mean or median average of the kern-edge would be one
idea.

This is my second experiment with Laurence Penney's kern-font
proposal. In this sample, I have combined three fonts from the Adobe
Garamond family: Regular (F1), Expert (F2) and Alternate (F3). This
demonstrates the cross-font kerning potential of Laurence's proposal.

In the first line, the characters are combined without any kerning
applied. This is how they would appear after ligature and alternate
substitutions in any word-processor or page-layout program.

In the second line, the kern-font spacing has been applied. Using this
system, I was able to create a better fit between the 'ff' ligature
and the following 'e', and nicely tucked the punctuation under the arm
of the terminal 't'.

John, your gif is essentially using sectored kerning.

Draw another red vertical line through the centre of each chracter.
(it doesn't have to be the exact centre, middlish is OK).

You've used approx. 8 different vertical positions for your boxes.
Let's say for now that there are eight sectors with fixed positions.
(this may not work as well, bt bear with me, I pray you)

From the centre-line, measure the distance first to the right and then to
the left of your rectangularised letter, in the middle of each of these
eight sectors.

This will give you eight pairs of numbers.  These represent the sector kerns
for that character.

The fitting algorithm is very straight-forward given such sectors.
You add the widths of sectors a pair at a time and take the largest as the
distance between vertical centres.

Most commercial sectored-kern systems I have seen only support 4 or 6 sectors,
which I always felt was too small a number.  It would be interesting to
try modifying our text engine (part of sqtroff) to handle larger numbers
of sectors, and then see what could be produced atomatically.

If you have fewer sectors, the fixed heights become more of a problem.
For example, with only 4 sectors, you can't really kern A and U together
as well as you've done it.  With six you can, although you need to save at
least one sector for lower case descenders.

All the fonts I have today use kern pairs, and sqtroff isn't available on
the Mac (Unix only), or I'd send you a demo.

With 196 glyphs in a font, and allowing at most 256 values for the width
on each side of centre (approx 512 ppem), 10 sectors would give us
196 * 10 * 2 bytes, or 3,920 bytes of kern information, stored in binary
format.

With only 16 values on each side, that could be halved to 1,960 bytes.

There is a variation that uses not the centre of the character, but the
left and right edges (respectively) of the bounding box.  In this case,
the numbers are smaller, and one can allow 256 values at 1000 ppem, but
in practice the numbers will usually be smaller.  This is the method used
in sqtroff, as I recall (it's been maybe 7 or 8 years since I looked at
using sectored kerning with sqtroff!).

Since kern pairs each have to have at least one character name (you can
deduce the other if you store the kerns along with, say, the left-hand
character), using sectors starts to save space after maybe a couple of
hundred kern pairs.  In theory, the sectors could be derived automatically,
which would certainly be a help.  And of course, if the heights of the
sectors are recorded (sqtroff didn't do this), you could kern across fonts,
with at least moderate success I should think.

I like this. I like it a lot. It does remind me of Intellifont's sectored 
kerning which could use an aribtrary number of sectors (although Agfa 
always used four) for which the position of the sectors was never known to 
the rasterizer (it was just numbers). Some fonts split the cap height up 
evenly into four sectors, some split the x-height into three even sectors 
and one for the rest, some split it up strangely.

Because there was no standard definition for where the sectors actually 
were, it wasn't possible to use kerning across fonts. A shame.

I understand the similarity to vectored kerning, but there are some
important differences in Laurence's proposal that I find interesting,
most importantly in the proposed application. There are two related
problems with vectored kerning, both of which you bring up in your
post. The first involves the number of sectors employed, and the
second, derived from the first, involves the quantity of kern data to
be included in the vector kerned font.

From a typographic point of view, it is the first problem that
concerns me most. Correct letterspacing is something of an exact
science. As you correctly point out, 4-6 sectors is hardly sufficient
to ensure correct spacing. In fact, such a system puts us right back
to the fitting problems of the Linotype machine: we would end up
having to adjust letterforms to fit the spacing system. What number of
sectors is sufficient? How much kerning data would result from such a
quantity? And how and where in the font would this data be stored?

What intrigues me about Laurence's proposal is a) the tailoring of the
kern-outline to each individual character form, and b) the storing of
such data in an invisible, background font from which the visible font
receives its spacing metrics.

>And of course, if the heights of the sectors are recorded

In my second experiment, I have applied Laurence's
principle to three fonts from the Adobe Garamond family, to show how
well the system works for cross-font kerning.

Now I think about it, the term 'kerning' actually becomes irrelevant
in the application of this system. Under Laurence's proposal there is
simply 'spacing', which, as any calligrapher or stonecutter will tell
you, is a function of the form of the letters, rather than of the
system employed to render them. This distinction is, perhaps, what
most appeals to me about the 'kern-font' proposal.

While it's clear that either a designer-specified kern edge or good sector
kerning would
- give good results for cross-font spacing
- do much better than kern pairs for unanticipated glyph combinations
within a single font, and
- probably do nearly as well as manually-spec'd kern pairs in anticipated
combinations,

one obvious drawback is that either approach would require a data format
that current applicaions and renderers are not prepared for. The other
obvious drawback is that no current fonts use either, so font collections
would have to be repurchased.

The 4 in Intellifont was a little low - I guess they were balancing quality 
with storage space. They did have the advantage that the positioning of the 
sectors was arbitrary - they could be completely different for every font - 
and so could be tuned to the font, but this makes inter-font kerning 
impossible. Agfa gave no kerning space to descenders.

It's a very compact method. Intellifont adjusts relative to the left and 
right edges widths in 54ths of an em. Didn't URW use a method of categorizing 
the left and right sides of characters and providing sector-based kerning for 
each category?

Sector-based kerning is such a good idea I really have no idea why it isn't 
used in the more commercial formats (the Amiga's main format is still 
Intellifont - or is that Intelephant?) I would like to see sector-based 
kerning become more common - with either standard positions for sectors or 
recording of sector positions. Inter-font kerning is highly desirable.

Who wants to persuade Microsoft to kludge sector-based kerning into their 
TrueType engine? :)

The beauty of Laurence's system is that it removes the need for kern
pairs, as such. Rather than having to second guess what letter
combinations are liable to crop up in an average user's texts, a type
designer would simply tailor the kern-outlines to his letterforms and
let these shapes determine all spacing. This means that every letter
would space itself optically with whatever was put beside it.

The phrase 'KsfsVQ yoTAv' is nonsense, but under the kern-font system
it would be perfectly spaced nonsense -- even the grammatically
impossible combinations such as  'sV' and 'oT'. Each letter would fit
its kern outline as neatly as possible to the adjacent letter's kern
outline.

This also means that designers like myself, who are keen to correctly
space their fonts for multilingual typesetting, will no longer have to
play at amateur linguistics trying to determine what kern pairs might
be necessary in typesetting Lower Sorbic.

The more I think about Laurence's proposal, the more I like it. If
someone wants to develop this as a font format, they'd better give
Laurence a big wad of cash for the idea.

As yet, I can't figure out if there's a way to build letterspacing
(i.e. increasing space in strings of uppercase text) into the
kern-font system. I suspect this might not be possible. Mind you, most
Type 1 and TT manufacturers don't take advantage of this possibility
in existing formats, so probably wouldn't notice the loss. It would
remain possible, of course, to letterspace within layout applications.

A nice idea, but technically more difficult to implement that sector-based 
kerning. Even if you massively increase the number of sectors, sector-
based kerning will still be much faster than an invisible type body.

As an aside to the main issue here.

With some systems for transcribing certain scripts into 
the roman alphabet such  mixed case "nonsense" can occur. 
For instance Tibetan has some letters and vowels which are 
sometimes reversed. In roman transcription when these occur 
they are usually indicated by a change of case. 

Other people use an upper case letter to indicate the main 
letter in a syllable  - as Tibetan has silent prefixes this
this looks like:  bsGrub brGyud   

There are also some strange combinations used in Pinyin the 
system of writing Chinese in Roman script widely used in China.
- Don't assume that you only need to make kerning pairs
for combinations that occur in European languages. 

Another kerning feature I'd like to see is the ability to kern more
than a pair of letters. Some scripts have subjoined letters
something like this:

               ACDEGH
               B  F
  
In this case A may need to kern with both B and C and E with F
and G.

I missed the beginning of the thread, but I think I've got a good
understanding of what you mean. So I thought you all would be interesting
in knowing that something like that already exists!
I have been using FontStudio for years (Did I tell you that I love this
program?... Yes, I did ;-)), and it has a special feature for
automatically creating kerning pairs and measures. In FontStudio, you have
two layers, front for creating glyphs, back for anything you want (very
useful to use vector models). You can trace in the background the
"kern-font" you speak about, and then ask FontStudio to generate kerning
pairs and measures using it. You specify the relative and/or absolute
distance between "kern-font" glyphs and just run it. It's well explained
in the doc. I thought that features was present in FOG, as autokern
fonction was mentionned in the adds. But, as you all doesn't seem to know
about it, I suppose that autokern in FOG doesn't work that way. That's
another reason for me not to get to FOG instead of FontStudio!
So I think you should get in touch with the developpers of FontStudio to
have information about their autokern engine (especially if you want to
include it in a font format (not in True Type, please, you all know
professionals dont want to deal with True Type -- maybe in OpenType?).
Give them a shake-hands for me!

The algorithms to touch bezier-edges are clearly more complex than normal
kerning or sector kerning, but rather less complex than rasterizing a
typical glyph. In any case, you could implement a kerning-cache!

Common combinations would get stored, on disk and in memory, after
preparing only a few documents - automatically adjusting to your language
and habits. You could store your "overrides" there too. Pre-computed
kerning tables could still be supplied with fonts, much like TrueType's
'hdmx' table (without which fonts are slowed down but otherwise
unaffected). Without cacheing (for bitmaps) and pre-computation (e.g. for
bounding boxes), scalable fonts would still be deathly slow...

Type Designer has an autokern feature that divides the space between
letters into up to 64 horizontal stripes and kerns them so that the
shortest stripe between two glyphs is always the same length. This gives
a reasonable rough kerning, though you need to adjust things like AH, which
would need to be closer serif-to-serif than HH but would be put the same
distance apart. The kerning is recorded in a perfectly conventional way,
of course. You can specify categories that are to be kerned with each other
or treated similarly - without which you would have a ridiculous number of
kerning pairs.

     Suppose I have a bunch of sample points from the boundary of a closed
volume in $R^3$.  Suppose in particular that I have been given the Delaunay
triangulation of these boundary points.  I'd like to interpolate a $C^3$
surface through these vertices.  The related surface-interpolation algorithms
I've found seem not to be applicable:  they either assume that the
triangulation is regular (usually of degree six) or that the surface is
monotonic with respect to some plane.
     Does there exist an algorithm to solve this problem?  References to

There are many ways to interpolate from a Delaunay tesselation.  The quickest
is with barycentric coordinates but is only $C^0$.  If you require higher

The trouble with countouring methods based on Delaunay triangulations is
that they can `click' (i.e. produce contours with spurious kinks) on
near-degenerate data.  It's better to use natural-neighbour interpolation
(invented by Robin Sibson) on the Voronoi dual of the Delaunay triangulation.
Start with

Sibson, R, and Thompson, G.D. `A seamed Quadratic Element for Contouring' and
follow the reference tree.

Applications of Voronoi Diagrams


Scot listed about twenty fields in which Voronoi diagrams are in
common use (although often not by that name).  

Anthropology and Archeology -- Identify the parts of a region under
the influence of different neolithic clans, chiefdoms, ceremonial
centers, or hill forts.

Astronomy -- Identify clusters of stars and clusters of galaxies
(Here we saw what may be the earliest picture of a Voronoi diagram,
drawn by Descartes in 1644, where the regions described the regions
of gravitational influence of the sun and other stars.) 

Biology, Ecology, Forestry -- Model and analyze plant competition
("Area potentially available to a tree", "Plant polygons")

Cartography -- Piece together satellite photographs into large
"mosaic" maps

Crystallography and Chemistry -- Study chemical properties of
metallic sodium ("Wigner-Seitz regions"); Modelling alloy structures
as sphere packings ("Domain of an atom") 

Finite Element Analysis -- Generating finite element meshes which
avoid small angles

Geography -- Analyzing patterns of urban settlements

Geology -- Estimation of ore reserves in a deposit using information
obtained from bore holes; modelling crack patterns in basalt due to
contraction on cooling

Geometric Modeling -- Finding "good" triangulations of 3D surfaces

Marketing -- Model market of US metropolitan areas; market area
extending down to individual retail stores

Mathematics -- Study of positive definite quadratic forms
("Dirichlet tesselation", "Voronoi diagram") 

Metallurgy -- Modelling "grain growth" in metal films

Meteorology -- Estimate regional rainfall averages, given data at
discrete rain gauges ("Thiessen polygons")

Pattern Recognition -- Find simple descriptors for shapes that
extract 1D characterizations from 2D shapes ("Medial axis" or
"skeleton" of a contour) 

Physiology -- Analysis of capillary distribution in cross-sections
of muscle tissue to compute oxygen transport ("Capillary domains")

Robotics -- Path planning in the presence of obstacles

Statistics and Data Analysis -- Analyze statistical clustering
("Natural neighbors" interpolation) 

Zoology -- Model and analyze the territories of animals



In addition to all these "real world" applications, Voronoi diagrams
have several applications within the field of computer science, in
particular, computational geometry.

Knuth's Post Office Problem -- Given a set of locations for post
offices, how do you determine the closest post office to a given
house?  (Apparently, Knuth was ignoring the existence of ZIP codes.)

Closest Pair -- Given a set of points, which two are closest
together?

All Nearest Neighbors -- Given a set of points, find each point's
nearest neighbor

Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree

Largest Empty Circle, also known as the Toxic Waste Dump Problem

Fixed Radius Near Neighbors -- Find all pairs of points closer than
a given distance apart.

All k Nearest Neighbors -- Find each point's k closest neighbors

Enumerating interpoint distances in increasing order -- Find the
closest pair, then the next closest pair, then the next closest
pair, and so on.



[A quick search through recent computational geometry literature finds
about 300 papers, almost all published in the last decade, with either
"Voronoi" or "Delaunay" in the title.  Over a third of those papers
were published since 1990.]


Voronoi Diagrams -- Definitions and Examples


A Voronoi diagram of a set of "sites" (points) is a collection of
regions that divide up the plane.  Each region corresponds to one of
the sites, and all the points in one region are closer to the
corresponding site than to any other site.

All of the Voronoi regions are convex polygons.  Some of them are
infinite -- these correspond to the sites on the convex hull.  The
boundary between two adjacent regions is a line segment, and the line
that contains it is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining
the two sites.  Usually, Voronoi regions meet three at at time at
Voronoi points.  If three sites determine Voronoi regions that meet at
a Voronoi point, the circle through those three sites is centered at
that Voronoi point, and there are no other sites in the circle.

So how would this be useful for solving, say Knuth's Post Office
Problem?  Suppose we had the Voronoi diagram of the post office
locations.  Then the find the closest post office to a given house,
all we need to do is figure out which Voronoi region the house is in.
This is an example of the "point location" problem.

Once we have the Voronoi diagram, we can solve the post office problem
as follows.  (This is not the best solution, but it's reasonably
simple.)  Draw a vertical line through each of the Voronoi points.
These lines split the plane into vertical slabs.  To locate a point p,
first do a binary search to find the slab containing p.  Within each
slab, there are no Voronoi points, so the Voronoi edges that cross
each slab do so nicely.  To find the Voronoi region containing p, we
just do another binary search, this time on the spaces between the
Voronoi edges in our slab.  Altogether, the search takes O(log n)
steps, where n is the number of sites.

Now let's look at the toxic waste dump problem.  You are given n
points in the plane, representing cities, and you want to put a toxic
waste dump as far from the cities as possible.  Obviously, the best
solution is to put the dump far away from ALL the points, but to make
the problem interesting, let's suppose we have to put the dump inside
the convex hull of the points.  With this contraint, the best place to
put the waste dump is either (1) on a Voronoi vertex, or (2) on the
midpoint of a convex hull edge, which must be on a Voronoi edge.



Delaunay Triangulations


The Delaunay triangulation is the dual of the Voronoi diagram.  To
build the Delaunay triangulation, draw a line segment between any two
sites whose Voronoi regions share an edge.  This procedure splits the
convex hull of the sites into triangles.

The Delaunay triangulation has a number of nice properties.  For
example, each point is connected to its nearest neighbor by an edge in
the triangulation.  Since the Delaunay triangulation is a planar
graph, it has at most 3n-6 edges, where n is the number of sites.  So
once you have the Dealunay triangulation, if you want to find the
closest pair of sites, you only have to look at 3n-6 pairs, instead of
all n(n-1)/2 possible pairs.

Here are some nice properties of the Delaunay triangulation:

It's dual to the Voronoi diagram, so computing one automatically
gives you the other.

The Empty Circle Property -- If you draw a circle through the
vertices of ANY Delaunay triangle, no other sites will be inside
that circle.

It's a planar graph.  By Euler's formula, it has at most 3n-6 edges
and at most 2n-5 triangles.  This property can be used to reduce
many problems with quadratic size (like closest pair) down to linear
size in the time it takes to construct the triangulation.

It contains "fat" triangles, in the sense that the minimum angle of
any Delaunay triangle is as large as possible.  In fact, if you
write down the list of all angles in the Delaunay triangulation, in
increasing order, then do the same thing for any other triangulation
of the same set of points, the Delaunay list is guaranteed to be
lexicographically smaller.




Variations on Voronoi Diagrams


One way of getting Voronoi diagrams is by growing crystals.  If you
start a number of crystals, all growing at the same rate, and all
starting at the same time, you get a number of growing circles.  As
these circles meet, straight line boundaries appear between them.
Eventually, the entire plane will be filled up.  Each crystal will
exactly fill up the Voronoi region of its point of origin.

This is a little too simple.  In reality, crystals start growing at
different times.  Even if they still grow at the same rate, if they
start at different times, they will no longer meet in straight lines.
Instead, they will meet in hyperbolic segments.  The diagram you get
is called the "additively weighted Voronoi diagram".  It's defined
just like the usual Voronoi diagram, but each site has a weight, and
you measure distance to a site, you add its weight to the usual
Euclidean distance.

Now suppose instead that all the crystals start at the same time, but
grow at different rates.  Now you get what's called the
"multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram".  Once again, each site is
given a weight, but when you measure the distance to a site, you
multiply by its weight.  Now the boundaries between different regions
are segments of circles.

This model still has some problems.  For example, in a multiplic-
atively weighted Voronoi diagram, it's possible for a region to be
disconnected.  Obviously, this can't happen with real crystals.  So
there's yat another version which treats existing crystals as
obstacles, and lets fast-growing crstals grow around the slower ones.
Now the boundaries between neighboring regions are sort of
tear-shaped.  This variation is called the "multiplicatively weighted
crystal growth Voronoi diagram."

There are several other variations.  You can change the metric from
the normal Euclidean distance to L1, or Lp, or
Linfinity, or even stranger distance functions.  You can
weight the sites additively and mulitplicatively.  You can change the
sites from points to line segments or circles or polygons.  You can
generalize to higher dimensions.  You can associate points with the
farthest site, instead of their nearest site.  And so on.

Different applications of Voronoi diagrams require different
variations.  For example, motion planning algorithims for circular
robots often use the Voronoi diagram of the obstacles.  If there is a
path from one location to another, then there must be a path that
follows the edges of the Voronoi diagram, since those edges are by
definition as far from the obstacles as possible.


Algorithms for Computing Voronoi Diagrams


There are literally hundreds of different algorithms for constructing
various types of Voronoi diagrams.  I will describe two of the
simplest.

The first algorithm inserts the points one at a time into the diagram.
Whenever a new point comes in, we need to do three things.  First, we
need to figure out which of the existing Voronoi cells contains the
new site.  Second, we need to "walk around" the boundary of the new
site's Voronoi region, inserting new edges into the diagram.  Finally,
we delete all the old edges sticking into the new region.

The second and third steps are the harder ones.  It's possible that
each new site's Voronoi cell will touch all the old cells.  Thus, in
the worst case, we end up spending linear time on each cell, or
O(n2)
time overall.  However, it has been proven that if you insert the
points in random order, the expected time is only O(n log n),
regardless of which set of points we're given.

A divide and conquer algorithm for constructing Voronoi diagrams was
discovered by Shamos and Hoey.  Split the points into two halves, the
leftmost n/2 points, which we'll color bLue, and the rightmost n/2
points, which we'll color Red.  Recursively compute the Voronio
diagram of the two halves.  Finally, merge the two diagrams by finding
the edges that separate the bLue points from the Red points

The last step can be done in linear time by the "walking ant" method.
An ant starts down at -infinity, walking upward along the path halfway
between some blue point and some red point.  The ant wants to walk all
the way up to +infinity, staying as far away from the points as
possible.  Whenever the ant gets to a red Voronoi edge, it turns away
from the new red point.  Whenever it hits a blue edge, it turns away
from the new blue point.

There are a few surprisingly difficult details left to deal with, like
how does the ant know where to start, and how do you know which edge
the ant will hit next.  (The interested reader is strongly encouraged
to consult the standard computational geometry literature for
solutions to these details.)

An additional point comes to mind as a result of a reply I got by E-mail. 
The target was evaluated for two parameters: the shift and the dispersion.
 Shift is measured from a laser boresight point and dispersion is *not*
measured from the boresight point, but rather from the center of the
smallest circle enclosing the 45 points.

Nice, assuming something like normal distribution.

    The problem is that the center of the smallest circle is
not necessarily the mean.

    I wonder whether the criterion is most effectively met
by the posted question.  If they want some % within a
certain-sized circle, then only THAT sized circle must be
considered.  Fix that radius as R.
    Calculate the mean, are enough holes within the circle of
radius R about that point.
    YES  => done.
    NO => what is nearest hole?  Does moving the circle to
cover that increase the number within circle?
    etc.  etc.

A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
alphametic)
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

 The problem of folding a sheet of paper so that a single straight cut produces a cut-out of a certain figure can be formulated mathematically as follows: Given a polygon with holes $P$ and a rectangle $R \supset P$, find a flat-folding of $R$ such that the cross-section of the folding with a perpendicular plane is the boundary of $P$. The authors give an algorithm to solve this problem. The strategy is to pack disks such that the disk centers induce a mixed triangulation/quadrangulation respecting the boundary of the polygon. The algorithm is based on results by R. J. Lang [in Proceedings of the twelfth annual symposium on computational geometry (Philadelphia, PA, 1996), 98--105, ACM, NY, 1996] and M. W. Bern and D. Eppstein \ref[Internat. J. Comput. Geom. Appl.  2 (1992), no. 3, 241--255; MR1194449 (94e:52016a)].

				The minimum expectation selection problem
				David Eppstein
and George S. Lueker
				Random Structures & Algorithms 21(3–4):278–292, 2002
				Mathematical Reviews 2003m:68054, 2003
				Reviewed by Marc Ulrich Stiller

				The authors discuss the min-min expectation selection problem (and variations): selecting $k$ out of $n$ given discrete probability distributions, to minimize the expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random variables are drawn from the selected distributions. They show NP-completeness (with a fully polynomial time approximation scheme), if the number of distinct values in each distribution is a constant greater than 2, and NP-hardness to approximate the problem within any constant approximation factor, if that number is an arbitrary integer. Finally they show that the related max-min problem (maximize the expectation) is polynomially solvable for a constant number of values in each distribution.

 The article is a very interesting example of demonstrating the interplay of probability theory and computer science. The reader should be familiar with the concepts of NP-theory, including the issue of approximation algorithms for such problems.

				Linear complexity hexahedral mesh generation
				David Eppstein
				Computational Geometry Theory & Applications 12:3–16, 1999
				Mathematical Reviews 2000a:68153, 2000
				Reviewed by Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo

				One important problem in mesh generation is how to extend a given mesh on the surface of a solid to its interior. Most results on such problems, especially theoretical ones, are restricted to the extension of triangular meshes to tetrahedral meshes. However, in practice, quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes are often preferred because of their numerical properties. Few theoretical results are known for this case. For planar meshes, it has been proved [S. Ramaswami, P. A. Ramos and G. T. Toussaint, Comput. Geom. 9 (1998), no. 4, 257--276; MR 98k:68169] that a polygon with $n$ sides can be meshed with convex quadrilaterals if and only if $n$ is even. Moreover, $O(n)$ Steiner points suffice as the vertices of the internal mesh, and they can be found efficiently. Thurston and Mitchell independently proved a similar result for spatial meshes, but it is restricted to solids whose boundaries are topological spheres. The resulting internal mesh is only topological, not geometric, in the sense that the hexahedral elements have curved boundaries and are not necessarily convex. Moreover, the size of the internal mesh is not linear in the size of the boundary mesh. In this paper, the author removes this restriction and proves that any polyhedron which is topologically a sphere and whose boundary is composed of an even number of quadrilateral faces can be meshed with a linear number of topological cubes. The author has made some progress in extending this proof to geometric meshes---only a finite number of cases are left to be tested, and this could be done by machine---but, as he points out, this extension would not be directly practical because the size of the interior mesh may be large, albeit linear, and its elements will be poorly shaped.

Assoc. 94 (1999), no. 446, 388--433; MR 2000i:62070] made the following two conjectures concerning the regression depth of points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space: Conjecture 1. For any $d$-dimensional set of $n$ points there exists a hyperplane having regression depth $\lceil\frac{n}{d+1}\rceil$. Conjecture 2. For any point set there exist a partition into $\lceil \frac{n}{d+1}\rceil$ subsets and a hyperplane that has nonzero regression depth in each subset. The authors prove the first conjecture and make some progress on the second. The problems arise in the context of robust regression and have a natural geometric formulation. The proofs are based on projective geometry and are consequently of a completely different nature from the usual proofs of theorems in the area of robust statistics. The authors also consider the computational aspects of the problems.

				Fox Chase Cancer Ctr., Research Computing Services

				Author, editor, or reviewer of:
				Probabilistic and unambiguous computation are incomparableSimultaneous strong separations of probabilistic and unambiguous complexity classes

				According to http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2001/view/e_spkr/937:

Jim Tisdall worked as a studio musician in Philadelphia, LA, and New York for several years. An interest in computer music led him to a degree in Mathematics from City College of New York, and to Unix and C, in 1980. Then he worked at Bell Labs in Murray Hill for six years, with Max Mathews, the inventor of digital signal processing and of computer sound. He discovered the formal language of musical rhythm while at Bell Labs. He also worked with Alan Gittler, the inventor of a marvelous, award-winning guitar with 10 patents. 

While at Bell Labs he earned a MS in Computer Science from Columbia University. His interests centered on computer science theory, and he left Bell Labs to pursue a PhD at the University of Michigan, and then at the University of Pennsylvania. 

He joined the Human Genome Project at UPenn in 1991 – where, as far as he knows, he was the first to use Perl in bioinformatics – then spent a year at Mercator Genetics in 1995. In 1996 joined Fox Chase Cancer Center. 

He is the author of the O'Reilly book "Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics", expected in retail stores in September. He teaches computer music at the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia, publishes the occasional bit of poetry, and just made his acting debut in a film version of Chekhov's plays.
